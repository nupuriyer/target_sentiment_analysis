You pulled a Bud lite move, suffer the wrath to come. You will soon be joining  all the other bankrupt companies out there. Disappointed and disgusted."

Oh but you bet they charged us for 2! 😡😡 Well after numerous emails and finally getting an actual human being on the phone, they have determined that this situation is resolved and there is nothing that they, Target, can do for me!

2289,0,Dear Target I am sorry I am breaking up with you I have given you plenty of chances for you to show me you love me but today was the last straw I am afraid you will fall by the wayside like my last love interest Gold Circle .. You started out so good Always there for me always feeding my needs .but lately you have become cheap and tawdry Everything you represent has become more costly but less quality and I so enjoyed our quality time together Your soft spot my dollar spot  has now become 3 and 5 dollar spot but what once i could giddily throw to wind at 1 now become a fiver and gone in no time broken plastic in the wind Heck your ugly brother the dollar store has made better choices So in closing I will be looking for a new passion and you will be seeing less and less eligible shoppers I hope you do not die a sad lonely death but find your true love again in quality products at a lesser price than you richer older brother T.J.MaxxSHARE PLEASE...because i really want to love Target again

2013,0,"Money is extremely tight for me this holiday season so I went on the target site all all but one store was out of stock on the item I needed.  I got in my car and went to the store, paid for parking, and an employee stated they don’t have the item(next model is $200 more).  I showed him the site and that it said it was in stock.  He said he would check, but I saw that he didn’t.  I asked to speak to a manager who stated they “probably sold out the previous day and the system wasn’t updated”.  I asked for a rain check and she said “they don’t do that”, so I asked if they would at least pay for my parking($2).  Again she said they don’t do that either.  So I get home and check the site one more time....guess what, still in stock.  So the made me waste approximately $10 with an assumption I would be saving $30, not to mention my time.  Could have ordered online and had it delivered for an additional $10!  They fooled me once, shame on me.  I will Never, Ever, shop there again, shame on them!"
1,0,"Target.com is the worst , they received my return August 3 it is now the 18th after contacting cs multiple times they finally said they issued a refund and to now wait an additional 7-10 more business days. Never order online AGAIN"
1028,0,Has Target started selling defective merchandise?  I purchased a king size jersey sheet set last week only to find it had been sewed in the middle to hide a tear.
2139,0,I stopped in looking for a pair of boys shoes size 7. I first went to the closest shoe section and was told that she would be in the men's section I went to the men's section and there was maybe 30 pairs of shoes available. So I asked a team member if there was another section he kept walking I said excuse me and he didn't bother turn around and I repeated my question while talking to his back and he pointed to his right I said well I've already been there they sent me over here he said well could be over there and he pointed to his left. He finally turned around and said I don't work in this section I don't know. While walking over to the area where I saw three Target team member standing I voice my frustration in stated the word useless. I told who I will leave was a section manager what happened she apologized and took me to the very first section I was at where the first team member said I was in the wrong section. This happened at the Woodbridge store on Dumfries Road at approximately 4:15 p.m. today. Horrible service. I hate going to Target more than I hate going to Walmart which is truly saying something.
1049,0,"This is the most poorly run company I have ever dealt with. Customer service is NIL!  They lost my Christmas order - it never shipped, BUT they did charge my credit cards...and now it will take until NEXT WEEK to get my money back. Duh....next week is CHRISTMAS!!!! And here I am without any gifts to give..."

2347,0,"I was given an Instant Pot for Christmas. It was bought online and I didn’t have a receipt. No big deal on getting it on a target card. No cash back. That’s fine and dandy until I find something I wanted but it was online and not even stocked in store anywhere. But, I can’t use my merchandise return card on online purchases even though ITS STILL TARGET. everyone in the Kalispell, MT store and even the corporate customer service line were completely rude and not helpful and didn’t even try to come up with a solution. I don’t understand how I am limited to instore purchasing when their selection for what I’m looking for is literally two items. Some of the most useless people I’ve ever met."
1086,0,"The pickup for registry could be better. I and others have tried to pick up items for a baby shower registry, The personnels in the station would not give me or the alternative persons the items that were ready for pick up even with the receipt and barcodes.The workers made rude remarks and said that they were not going to give us the order. I am still confused to why that happened. The registry is set for monroe louisiana at that particular target so there couldn't have been any mistakes for it to go to another target pick up.Target refunded me because I didn't pick up the items but we tried."
1213,0,"I really LOVE Target but DON'T buy food at Target.  The Jr Mints appear to have been left in the heat and sun of a loading dock for weeks, the Pocky were also melted and fused into one big fat Pocky stick and the Pringles were so crushed we had to toss 80% of the can out.  Target, this is NOT up to your standard.  And this is not acceptable with the increase in food (okay snack) prices lately!"
1496,0,"My wife and I went to target in Redwood City today. My wife was one of under 50% of the shoppers that wore a mask!  Many employees were not wearing masks. Customers were not practicing the 6 foot rule. Very dangerous store to shop at. Customers did not give a s___! About protecting the public or the employees. Target doesn’t care either. Rules in that area don’t matter! I called Target Corporate, The person said they knew nothing about the corporate policy that was all over the internet. I then hung up. Last time ever at Target"
2437,0,Worst online site ever. Sale prices are only good while item is out of stock. Then  coincidentally the same time sale ends item comes in stock. Very shady business practice from target. Would expect much more from such a large retailer that has so much competition in there market.
728,0,"Absolutely terrible online experience.  Many products cannot be ordered online and shipped; you have to pick them up in person...I mean seriously what is this 1998?  Why can't you just ship everything like Walmart and Amazon do?  When Target actually does ship items they take FOREVER to arrive...I'm talking 5-10 days before you get your entire order.  When packages go missing the Target website is worthless and it is impossible to correct the issue online.  You have to actually call Target customer support and spend 20 minutes on the phone.  There is a ""Fix This"" feature on Target's website which doesn't work.  Target's support staff is overseas and it's impossible to understand what they're saying.  Target is 20 YEARS behind the competition and their online store is worthless.  Zero stars."
508,0,Horrible customer service ! Order over 50$ worth of food for drive up and it’s been 8 hours since I made the order. I made the order early so I could pick up by maybe this afternoon and it’s still processing. I call the store to get an update and it rings for 3 mins and hangs up on me. I was calling for the customer service line to be clear and once it transferred me it rang forever it felt like then hung up. I call the 800 number and they tell me I have to wait 24 hours to get an update and if no update they will just refund me. That’s so stupid! I have a special needs toddler and going into the store is difficult! So the drive up feature has saved me but this is ridiculous and I won’t be doing that ever again I’m willing to go else where.
2568,0,Hands down! You can always find good deals on Target. Just don't try their online store.
2166,0,"Just know that Target.com allows thieves to charge your stolen credit card online to buy merchandise out their store without having your correct billing address and zip code. My VISA was stolen and the person charged my account on Target.com without using my correct name or address .When I called target.com, they stated that all a person needs to use your stolen credit card is the three digit code on the back and the actual credit card number."
1068,0,"I ordered my gift cards online because of the delivery date.  These cards were to be delivered on 12/9 which was ok but I have to mail these cards out so i didn't have much room for delay.  Today is 12/12 and my cards have still not been delivered now I am being told that they are scheduled for delivery today(although the tracking says the number is invalid!) by supervisor Logan, at Target gift cards.  I have a delivery ready to be picked up at the local store and I am being told that the cards have already shipped and i have to wait, instead of them just voiding the cards and let me get them with my pick up order(been with Target 21 years , wow!).  BE CAREFUL TARGET GIFT CARDS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, NO HELPFUL!!!"
933,0,"We were robbed 4,000.00 through the target gift cards set up. Apparently someone from the store is stimulating gift cards sales and immediately cash them through the store. Despite numerous attempts Target refuse to cooperate into investigating the issues under the disguise of consumer confidentiality. Which led me to believe that it’s an inside job. BEWARE OF TARGET GIFT CARDS SCAMS"
26,0,This company will sell you something online or in app and not have it and say your money will be back in you account  in less than the normal 5 to 7 buisness days. This is a crock of s@@@. That being said this Columbus far SW will do nothing to help you or make it right. Do not use this store.
2582,0,"Ordered 2 rugs with Premium shipping options. When I ordered it said Get it by 24th, nothing was even shipped on 23rd. So I called and they made me order with Express, which said get it By tomorrow on their website. its 24th and not even shipped. When I call them, they tell me Express shipping starts to count after 24hours. Then why the hell it said get it by certain date and its not even processed by that day? Customer Service is Horrible. They are worst than robots, only know book answers"

588,0,Placed an online order. Received confirmation. Target canceled my order stating they made a pricing error. Target will not honor price posted.
258,2,"Target is trash. They used to be a step up from Walmart, but now? Not at all. I've seen behind the curtain at how they're treating their workers, expecting more work from fewer employees, reducing pay, cutting hours for the lowest of the low. Target treats its employees like third world sweatshop labor--and the outcome? Look at the quality of their products, the filthy mess of junk around their stores, the longer & longer lines due to no one to run the registers and the incredible increase in their prices. You can say ""economy"" or ""inflation"", but Brian Cornell's (CEO) salary hasn't been cut, top peeps in the company are getting fatter claiming hikes are due to ""inflation"". This is solely an excuse to stick it even further into the lower class, double or triple prices in some cases, lower quality and buy another fleet of yachts."
1839,0,"I went to Buckhead South location (round 9.15pm) & after having a bad day for a sim kit & card. I didn’t know what to expect really because this is my first time trying to buy prepaid Sim cards and kits. I was nervous and Clueless. Not only was Front manager on duty pleasant when I walked In to the store & still frustrated /curious,not knowing which way to go...An ANGEL, employee named Jared🥰 popped out of nowhere and made my day so much better after having a bad day. Checked out fast & I gained knowledge. He knew his stuff, answered ALL questions & I’m smarter & happier than I was When I walked in. Thank u Jared in the back of Target Buckhead South by the SIM cards. EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH MY OPINION 💯🙏🏾🥰"

I called on the 20, was told no worries it will arrive on the 23. Called on the 22nd, order still not moved, Still insisted it will arrive on the 23rd std ship. What a lie, I went ahead and cancelled and ordered something else from  Amazon."
821,0,"I was looking for damp rid and asked Gustavo who was working that day, and he was so extremely helpful not only did he checked to see if they had some in stock he gladly told me and show me where I can find it. Extremely happy to have run into someone so helpful and sweet. We need more employees like him! Who ever hired him did a great job! -(Hillside Target )"
1492,0,"My packages are arriving the next day!  I am so happy because my orders weren't coming in from Amazon, likely due to high demand, but Target not only has really good brands, I can trust them.  I have ordered so much stuff from Amazon that turned out to be knock offs (specifically Native Deodorant)  BE careful when you get products from them!  My experience with Target has been so much better than Amazon, I am glad that I switched! LOVE their product selection and quality!"
2277,0,"Ordered a patio set as a gift. Everything was fine, received tracking number and was contacted by shipping company with a delivery date. They did not show or contact us. Received an email with another delivery date. They did not show and did not contact us. When they were contacted they said one of the three pieces were missing and they would have to check the dock which took 3 days. Couldn’t find it there so they needed to check 2 other docks which took 3 days. Finally on April 11th after originally being told it would be delivered on March 28th we were told they couldn’t find the third piece and gave us a 800 number to call. There I was told they would refund my money and help me reorder. I was then informed the patio set was out of stock but they were having nice sales and maybe I could find something cheaper. How nice that never once was any offer made to help make me feel better about the less than acceptable performance especially after I politely expressed my disappointment."
1290,0,"After scouring the internet looking for a particular item, I came across this shop. Absolutely perfect. Easy to use the site, prices is a good range to choose from! Shipping was not very quick in this time, but it doesn't matter. I Will definitely buy again, thank you!"

After placing an order on target.com to pick up from a store that is 20 miles out of my way because it was the only store with the product in stock, only to get there and it is not in stock.  To include I have to wait 4-5 days for the money to post back to my account.  I called customer service to file a complaint and all they could do was apologize.  Never again"

401,2,"I went shopping at the target in RiverGate located in Charlotte,North Carolina, just over the border from South Carolina. I was there at 9 AM it’s not like the store was crowded or had a lot of people in it. However, the store looked like it had been ransacked with clothes in the women’s department all over the floor, stacked up in piles, you could not get near the dressing room with all the carts full of clothes that needed to be put away. I took several pictures, I talk to the store manager (for that day), Who told me that the normal store manager was off today. I called corporate, offered them pictures, they did not seem very interested. I asked for some response back from them, and was assured that my complaints would be taken seriously. I have never been in a store that looked as bad as the store looked today. This should never be allowed to happen when you have people working in a store, and trust me there were many people working in the store. Doing what? I’m not sure. I will no longer be shopping at that Target"
529,0,"I went looking for an outdoor lawn chair. The way target has them on the floor, you can get them lay it out to see how it works and looks. And if you like it. Well, I couldn't get one of the legs to securely tighten. I have arthritis on my hands. They hurt a lot. I asked a worker. She replies: we are not suppose to open packages. I was like WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT? I told her well I am not going to buy it if the back feet keep folding in. I am going to crack my head if I fall back. They are just folded up leaning against the wall. She goes onto call another worker. HE comes by and says oh I am sorry, I don't know anything about this. He stood there for a few seconds then conveniently disappeared without saying a word. You'd think he would say< you know what let me see if I can get someone to help you. Nope not even that. Boy that angers me. You have a simple bloody job yet you can't even do that. Or bothered to do it. Must be nice to have a job and not do a damn thing but show up."
16,0,I am very upset with target because when I returned an item because it was too small they gave me a gift card so I bought another different outfit but larger comes out I didn’t like the fabric so I returned it but because I used a gift card they can only refund me my money on a gift card when originally I had paid by cash. Never again will I allow for them to put on a gift card. They do not have nice clothes there.
409,0,"Easily half of the things that I ordered did not end up in my final order. Though they would show up in stock online and while I put them in my cart and go to check out, apparently they were out of stock when it came time for the store shoppers to collect my things. On top of that, there was an instant dollar off coupon on one of the bags of vegetables that the cashier never bothered to use. It was just an all-around bust."
1823,0,"Really... the Honey Pot commercial is enough to make me boycot Target.  It could have specified a woman-owned business or even a minority owned business but it specifically says make it easier for the next black girls to start a business?????  What about other women???  Let's see some solidarity for women in general no matter their background, color, religion, race, beliefs, etc.... Honey Pot and Target...you both lost my business!!"

1311,0,I understand we are all experiencing difficulties but the response to a request to return an item which was the same colour  but not the same design or fabric as displayed on the web page was extremely poor and the eventual offer of a 10% refund absolutely crazy.
2054,0,"I used to love Target because their prices were as cheap as Walmart and it was a lot closer and it more pleasant shopping experience. Now I have to jump through hoops to get the same low prices Walmart offers, first there was cartwheel, now its called Circle. I get tired of having to scan all the items in my basket before I get to the register, then you never know if it's going to work  if I don't do things in the exact proper order it doesn't come off my ticket or the cashier says they can't scan my circle if I've already put in my Target card but other cashiers say I can! Then cashier says, oh well I guess you'll have to go to customer service. I'm sorry Target but Walmart is just easier I go, get one low price and get out."
1624,0,"I love Honeypot.  But the white people commenting are indicative of the problem of racism world wide.  Its BLACK HISTORY MONTH in the US but a BLACK OWENES COMPANY is not entitled to say how they are PROUD TO BE BLACK which is indicative of the WHITE PRIVILEGE that these people have.  Many of these people are not in the US but some are and it angers them that ANYONE WOULD BE PROUD TO BE BLACK.  You have white privilege.  The right to try to ruin someones business because a black business says on BLACK HISTORY MONTH that they are happy to be black in a country that has to have a month dedicated to BLACK HISTORY so that the whites in that society remembered that they had enslaved its ancestors, raped its women, hung its young men, continue to shoot its young black men for walking in the wrong neighborhoods unarmed, for mass incarceration of its youth for petty issues that white kids do not even go to court for.  That's not even the half.  I am an upper middle class African American, I pay high taxes and health insurance and i still get misdiagnosed based on my race even though i pay $600 a month for health insurance.  I am 46 years old and have stage 4 kidney failure because my medical practitioner didnt report to me that I was in Kidney Failure 6 YEARS AGO!!!  A white person would have been diagnosed 6 years ago.  I have 47% kidney function.  A white person my age should have 100% kidney function.  GFR is your kidney function.  A white person of my age should have a GFR of 100%. A black person of my age should be 120%.  6 years ago, it was 82%. That white ""medical practitioner"" didnt know that even if you stupid and cant do math, I should at least have the GFR of a white person. She said she couldnt understand the math.  Then she did the typical ""WHITE FEMALE GASLIGHTING"" and said she was under a lot of pressure cause she has a son.  She had her son 1 year ago.  What about the other 5 years she didnt tell me of my kidney functions or send me for other test? White women will gaslight you all day.  WHITE WOMEN were the most brutal slave owners, read the history books.  That's why black women are still made to be over or under sexualized.Honeypot is a great company.  I have sensitive skin and use them often. Dont listen to white hate campaigns. Their time is over and they are scared."

I placed my first online order on Target.com and everything went smoothly.  Item was shipped quickly and in good shape.  However, I had to return the item, so I went to my local Target store.  Customer Service tells me that because I paid through PayPal, they can either issue me a cash refund or Target gift card.  WTH?  I chose the cash refund, except I was shortchanged $0.27 and didn't realize this until I got home.  I wasn't going to waste gas money driving back for that amount.  Lesson learned.  Target.com would have gotten 5 stars, but I deducted 1 star for each issue I experienced."

Since the woke and satanic line of clothing have been introduced and supported, we will no longer be shopping at Target, and will take our business elsewhere.

170,0,I want to like target I want to believe target is a store catered to us … but it’s not. Everything is overpriced and the sales people are rude
1470,0,We live in a different world today I get that. But also I do not like my point of decision being taken from me without knowing it. Target would not allow me to return a item I bought 15 mintues prior. When I came thru the from doors their sign notifying customers of new hours. But noticeably absent was the new policy return. Cashier when I checked out didn't say a word about it. A real store like Amazon gives you a credit before you even return the item and does it with a smile. Target they blind side you with a knee jerk decision that benefits them not the customer. Target at one time you were ok now you moved Wal Mart off the bottom of most hated ... Your a bottom feeder
758,0,I received three Target Gift Cards as Wedding presents (2 e-gift cards and 1 physical gift card). I had to call customer service to activate the e-gift cards because they were connected with the purchasers account instead of our wedding registry account. We finally got the e-gift cards to work after calling customer service. We tried to use our physical gift card and it was also connected with another account. We check the balance and tried to use it in the store (30 minutes later) cashier said it was an invalid gift card. Checked the balance after leaving the store and it said it was $0. Within 30 minutes we went from a $50 to $0 gift card and didn't even use it. I called CS and they said I need the receipt number from the purchaser so they can investigate the unauthorized purchase further. What a freaking joke. Note to anyone adding gift cards to wedding registry from Target. Don't.  Just ask for cash.

The 2 women at the store argued it was the correct one or it must have been an online problem, they didn’t offer a resolve they just told my husband he had to take it anyway and call customer service if he wanted a refund! Bad customer service as far as i’m concerned! we went home and called the customer service number and they told us to keep the current game and they would order us the correct one. 2 days later it arrives at our home and it’s the same (wrong) game escape room 3 not 4. we are now into December 7th and we are on the phone with customer service again who by their attitude aren’t trying to fix anything the lady said we could take it to the store for a refund as if it’s botherisome  her to deal with the problem, so we ask for a manager she tells us the manager is busy we have now been on hold for an hour! these people just talk over you instead of listening, and never find a solution and basically are telling you it’s your fault!

I gave them four days and called them back. The statement I got was that they would return the money and apologizes for the inconvenience for loyal customers.  I see how Target treats its loyal customers. This has nothing to do with the product; it's about Target and how terrible they are.  Don't order from target online."

This was a store my daughter and I enjoyed going into at least 2-3 times every couple weeks. We can't  bring ourselves to go back. I'm  sure they will not miss our service and be just fine financially,  even with a lot of people going elsewhere.  You are not Tar`get. You are Target.

I was once an employee as well, so I have been a big supporter of Target. I have never had any issues with it before. I don’t know if it was the company or the season, but the shipment got pushed back twice. So I call the help desk and they had nothing to say on why the order date was pushed back. They said it was an estimated date. And then I asked if it could be canceled and they told me no. I knew that my order was supposed to be here on the 24th so I go to check on it all to find out my order has been canceled. I have had terrible notification on this and now I don’t have a Halloween costume for my daughter when I ordered it weeks ago!! I will never use target.com again. And this is exactly why everything is being bought online at other places specifically Amazon. Yeah their shipment maybe delayed due to weather but that is one thing. We aren’t in winter yet and their shouldn’t have been any issues getting it here."
45,0,"I have been a loyal target customer who goes to target like 2-3 times a week, I have been incredibly upset by the agenda being pushed on me. The past few years pushing agenda and Satanic culture has me at a breaking point with this store. It's not a matter of being on the left or right. However I am Catholic and the store is promoting Satanic culture. It's to the point where I can't justify spending money there nor can I support this business if they at any point think what they are selling is ok. Thankfully there are plenty of other options in the world where political and religious beliefs aren't being forced on the consumer."

Received 12/17 a.m. email saying delivered.  But they had not been.  Tried tracking and the info said check your porch, back door, etc.  Check with your neighbors.  Cards were finally delivered 12/17 afternoon.  Worst tracking info.  Would not bother ordering online from Target.  Other stores are able to keep you updated."

288,0,"I recently returned an item to Target only to find out that the item is a 3rd party vendor item.  Target provided the return label for UPS but did not state the item had to go to the 3rd party vendor's distribution center instead of Targets.  Why, I ask, did Target provide a UPS return label that sent it to Indiana instead of NJ?  In speaking with Target's ""no customer service"", they refused to confirm the item had been received even though the UPS tracking proved it had been.  They also could not provide a contact number to the 3rd party vendor in order for me to check to make sure the item was received.  They stated it takes up to 10 days for the item, once received, to be scanned in for proof.  Are these people just lazy or in a union?  Amazon knows your item is coming the minute UPS scans it and they start your refund.  I can't believe this company is still in business with their apathetic customer service employees.  They love the fact they don't actually have to help you resolve your issue and repeat the script about their policy, which is, ""There's nothing we can do for you because the item you ordered is a 3rd party vendor.""  I actually had one no customer service employee tell me to google the name of the 3rd party vendor in order to contact their distribution center.  I had already done that and there's no way to contact them.  How convenient.  I told the rude Target no customer service employees they would not get payment from me for the item since I no longer had it.  I'm done with Target and am tearing up my card."
565,0,"Target is the worst online provider. I ordered a product on January 8, confirmed. Then they started taking the money out of my bank account and putting the money back every other day for six weeks then they cancelled my order without telling me. All of the sudden it arrives three months later at my door when they cancelled the order on me. What a screw up company!!!!! Never again."
951,0,"I ordered some items a week ago on 2/12.  It was due to arrive the 22nd.  Then I got emails 4 consecutive days saying the order was being delayed to the 23rd, 24th, 25th, and now 26th (I'm assuming I'll get another email tomorrow saying 27th).  I understand weather is a factor in transit but these haven't even been boxed, given a tracking number, and put on a truck yet.  I called to cancel the order but they're preparing to ship them and can't cancel it, even though the status has been preparing shipment for 7 days.  Stick to Amazon."
2201,0,"Ordered a Nintendo switch game and it came a day early, the case did at least. The case was still in the plastic and when i opened it there was no game. Target stole 52 dollars from me.  When i tried to fix the issue on the website it said that the item was nonreturnable."
836,0,"Outstanding online shopping experience.  I shop online mostly at AMZ, however Target is a close second.  When I can I will shop online to get superior customer service ALWAYS backing up any errors.  NEVER once did they not want to fix something even if it meant getting more than I paid for.  I am so grateful for Target, and would encourage others to shop here as they are the best among all the big box stores for general merchandise."

383,0,"While Target's in-store experience is very good, their call center support is extremely bad, both in chat session and IRL talking with an agent.  Target has off-shored their call center.  But it appears that they've picked the lowest cost provider to contract with.  Their agents are basically ESL or less speakers and do not have any grasp of the English language written or spoken.  They also do not have any relevant IT expeience and so not understand even the basics of how their online systems work.As others have noted here, the Chat agents will transfer you from one agent to another.  You have to start all over with each agent, even though everything is already stated in the Chat transcript ... like my name and what ithe problem is.My problem was Target's system would not let me post a review. None of the Chat agents understood the problem. So, I finally called them.  After spending 15mins talking with an agent, mostly repeating what I'd said,  that agent told me that he could not fix the problem and told me to go to the Target store ... DUHH??"

1117,0,I have a health issue that causes me to not be able to wear a mask. The workers at Target harass me when I shop inside the store even though they cannot ask why I am unable to wear the mask. Because of this I stopped going into the store and started doing the drive up pick up service. Now I am being told that I have to wear a mask to pick up my orders. Horrible customer service!
2257,0,"I was suprised by the lack of fursuits available at target in Winston Salem, North Carolina.

1096,0,"I have been a loyal Target shopper and have enjoyed shopping there. This is the 3nd time I have found items at Target on the website that say delivery and when you try to place your order, the items ""can not be shipped"".   The products could be delivered same day, in many zip codes,  it could be picked up in the store, but it couldn't be shipped-really.  Had the products been for me I would have picked them up @ the store.  All 3 times the items were gifts, one was off of the Baby Registry,  how bizarre, I couldn't have company Registry items shipped to the registror. I guess I'll shop @ Kohls, they took my $$ and shipped the product."

2312,0,I would give no stars if I could! I order online to pick up in store for that day to pick up a stroller. I went before I receive the email saying it was ready. I get to the store and check the same website and now the stroller is less than half price.  If the stroller had been there I would’ve paid $76 for it but because I went in the store to pick it up and then I checked the website while they were trying to figure out where the stroller was the stroller was only $35.  So I was told that they would tell the people in the back not to process the stroller. I check and Target still has me as being process for the stroller and still has my money. I call customer service and they inform me that I have to wait for the store to receive the stroller because it’s coming from a warehouse. Why would you ship it if the store has it in stock? Then I have to wait 7 days after it arrives for it to cancel out because there is no cancel button. Target has gone shady in their business transactions. The switch and bate  tactics are very shady. And the cancellation policy is ridiculous. I’m done shopping there.
2007,0,"WORST ONLINE EXPERIENCE EVER! Place a large order on cyber Monday and the charge went through as pending then 2 days later disappeared. When I called to find out why I was on hold for a lengthy time then was disconnected when transferred to a department that could help (after going through the story once). So I called back, held again, went the the details again and asked to speak with a supervisor. I have a hard time believing who we were transferred to was indeed an actual supervisor as she was HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL (her name was Charisma) Anyway, another phone call later, another “supervisor “ and another long on hold wait period before we found out why the order was cancelled...never did get a reason why no one bother to call us to let us know it was cancelled...luckily we pay close attention to our bank account and caught it quickly. After all that they offered to replace the order but I decided to take my box else where...thanks in no small part to Target’s “Charisma”. RIDICULOUS the amount of time and energy we wasted on this company for nothing!"
2486,0,"This is the third time I've used Target to send a gift to someone through their online gift registry, and all three times Target messed up the order. On this most recent experience, I placed the order online to have their baby gift sent directly to their home, along with what was supposed to include my note of well-wishes to them. Instead what they got was the item only -- no name or gift message included with the gift.  After more than 90 MINUTES on the phone to Target ""Customer Service"" getting transferred from one foreign-based agent to another, I still couldn't get them to understand or make restitution for a gift I had sent as part of the recipient's gift registry, which arrived to the recipient without any indication of whom it was from and without my well-wishing message. Yesterday was their baby shower and I as far as the recipient knew (which I just found out now), to her knowledge I had totally forgotten her baby shower, which I in fact hadn't. What an embarrassment to me and disappointment to her. One of the agents, who I could barely understand because of her heavy accent, told me that if the recipient had only gone online and looked at their registry, they would've seen that the gift was from me. You've got to be kidding!! DON'T USE TARGET FOR YOUR GIFT REGISTRIES!! THEY'RE A TOTALLY INEPT COMPANY!!"
1157,0,Wanted to make a purchase using my redCard online. Found out my card was expired and I never received a replacement card. ALSO had a credit balance of $87 from paying too much on my previous bill. Customer service could not place my order for me so I could use my balance they owe me but also my 5% off for using my card! I am so upset because I’ll probably miss out on the sale! CS rep and his supervisor sounded like they could care less and offered me NOTHING. No wonder they have a poor rating! They should my rating should be less than one star
1966,0,"Target lies about delivery dates and fraudulently makes promises about when items are available. Ordered an item on cyber monday. Delivery was to be by 12/10. 12/10 delivery changed to 12/14. Target's tracking showed it hadn't shipped yet. I did a chat with customer service, rep checked and said it would be delivered by the 12th which is when I needed it. 12/12 - not there. Did another chat - oh it's shipped but won't be here until the 14th and no i can't cancel until i receive it. Then someone created a shipping label to make it look like it shipped. Today the 13th it still hasn't shipped. Will never order here again, and am returning everything I bought to Target and will never shop there again. Amazon just gained a customer."
281,0,"Placing my pickup order online was easy. However, the Target at the Irvine Spectrum requires that you wait in the same line as general returns to pick up an online order. There were five people in front of me, all of which who were returning cartfuls of 20+ items. What was supposed to be a time-saving online pickup took forever. I will not choose this option again based on this experience"
1911,0,Omg ordering from target online was awful.  I ordered everything to be delivered to my house.  One item said pick up so I called and tried to have it switched.  The lady was rude and tried charging me 5.99 for shipping for a pack of Qtips.  Ridiculous and I will never order from them online again.

I then requested a refund, confident that they would give me a 100% discount for such horrible customer experience. Nope. They were very unhelpful and unwilling to make the issue right. I will never shop at target again, store or online."
2444,0,"Do not EVER buy ANYTHING from Target online!!  They sent someone else's order (with their packing slip and a product, worth $120 less than my order, that I can't even use) in my box with NONE of my items in it. I lost ALL my Black Friday deals because they are now out of stock and can't reship them. I've talked to 5 people now (including a supervisor) and am STILL trying to get my refund so I can find those items somewhere else (and now I will also miss out on all the other Cyber Week deals). Their customer service is the WORST. Sad because I used to love Target. Sticking with Amazon or Walmart for now on!"
333,0,"I placed an order online.  When I came to pick up my order, I saw a bunch of employees chatting with each other but nobody cared to take care of order pick up.

One of them said, ""whatever!""This is how good their customer service is."
419,0,"If I could give them zero stars I would. I buy most of my diapers from Target because they offer a gift card promotion usually.  This time the deal was but $100 dollars in diapers and receive a $30 gift card. So, I bought two big packs of Pampers and one smaller one for a total of $119.18.  I did drive up pick up and I get to my store to be told sorry they were out of one of the big packs.  No problem, the app told me I could either get it shipped or I could simply go up the road to a different Target store & pick up the pack they were out of stock of.  I chose to go up the road.  I get to the second location and pull in and then the app shows my order is CANCELLED!  So I call Target because my bank is being charged the full 119.18.  The first customer service rep was rude and insisted that I was charged the correct amount. I asked to speak to a supervisor and got hung up on.  Three calls later they explained that it’s just an authorization and when the app updates it will adjust for the correct amount and my bank balance will adjust.  Ok, so I wait and 3 days later it’s adjusted on the Target app for a total of 78.03.  Perfect—until I check the bank and there’s 3 separate and nonsensical charges one for 21.86, one for 33.58 and one for 30.00.  None were for the cost of the diapers purchased, but one was for the cost of the gift card i was promised despite Target being out of stock by the store manager when I went to the second store. It took two more calls to customer service and talking to a supervisor to get the charges adjusted to reflect the actual cost of what I paid for, a difference of almost $10. They gave me the worst runaround ever, but all I wanted was to be charged for what I actually bought. What a joke Target customer service is!  Rude, unhelpful and uneducated about their own policies. I never want to be a Karen, but I was so aggravated that I was going to get my just  refund if it meant I needed to call the Attorney General at this point. This is the second time I’ve had an issue with Target mis-charging my account too.  The receipt has one number and my card was charged a different amount.  The first time it was negligible like 2.86, so I just ate it bc I didn’t want to spend the time, but this time I wasn’t going to let them do this.  I still have not received the money in my bank account and if I don’t get it I will be calling and raising hell again.  It’s such a shame… I usually love Target but this was a TERRIBLE experience as an amputee mom of 2 babies I’ll NEVER shop at Target again after this fiasco.  Also, I want to point out that when I ordered on the app it said that there were 8 to 10 of each type of box of diaper in stock, and at both stores their stock count was completely in accurate. Shame on you target.  I think I should contact the AG…especially because I can prove they’ve done this before to me.  How many unwitting people just trust that Target isn’t skimming off the top?  Please check your receipts and debits"

I believe it is there because tracking on the shipment shows delivered.  I get back to office to find only 1 of the 2 items in the box.  I call Target on Dec. 20th and they promise express shipping and say it will arrive by the 21st or the 22nd.  On the 22nd, no package, check tracking and it is still :""processing"".  I call again, and was told they would express ship again  to arrive on Saturday (which won't work because I live in rural area and they don't deliver on Saturday) so I ask that they deliver to my son's address which they agree, but.....in the meantime the cost of the item is now $10.00 higher and I would have to pay them again for the item I have already purchased and they failed to ship TWICE, plus express shipping.

1891,0,"It was pleasant until target recently started to charge bag fee. The first time they charged me $1 and didn't refund when I rejected the bag fee. I had to call them, and went to the store to pick up the $1 myself. The 2nd time I rejected the bag fee, but they charged me $.10 twice so made it $0.2.  I called, was put on hold and was hung up. How did I know? I kept track of my gift card balance in target all the time. If millions of customers have $0.1 miscalculated, image what the total it will be.Edit on 1/6/2020, they refunded me $.1. But they still owe me $.1 which will never be paid to me unless I called, explained, etc. And this $.1 will not be refunded me automatically. I will have to go to the store to pick the dime up. My gas cost is more than that."

585,0,I cant even believe how insulted I am! I ordered the Revolution x Disney Story book collection I ordered Arile Palette and lip gloss and Belle Palette. These Palettes are $20 each the lip gloss was $6.99. Then ad tax to that. I waited got excited just for them to send me 2 Palettes that look nothing like the Disney collection not even Disney at all just 2 Revolution Palettes colors don't look like the Palettes and didn't get the highlighters or blush in it and the lip gloss wasn't even close it was a dark plush pink!! Then I learn not only is The lip gloss now sold out but what they sent me equaled $20 in total and they still took my full $50 !!! What!! You couldn't send me at least what would equal what I spent no you changed $20 Palettes for $8 ones and a $3.99 lip gloss. Even if it was close the whole point of getting the collection is for THE LOOK!! I was expecting palettes that looked like Story books and had my favorite characters on them and instead I got plain Palettes of just eye shadow!! Yeah Target said they will send me replacements but point is they still did it tobegine with and now I can't even get the lip gloss honestly I was trully looking forward to getting the gloss the colors were so pretty and my freind got it Im not one for a color gloss just plain or glittery it would of fit me perfect and now I can't even get it!! It was the first and last time I will ever order from Target.com you have lost my trust.
2369,0,Target online is a joke... I ordered a Christmas Present on 12/15 with a promise of two day shipping from target they claimed my package would be here on 12/19 of course that day came and passed and it’s not two days after Christmas 12/27 and the package is still “in transit”. I contacted customer service about the matter two days before Christmas and she told me that “two day shipping is not guaranteed and that I’m going to have to wait .” I was livid. I understand sometimes packages take some time but it’s now 11 days and still nothing? I ended up getting the gift at Walmart instead and I’m waiting for this package to come in the mail so I can go to target to return it. Absolutely ridiculous. I will NEVER order from target online again.
1318,0,I visited the Target location at 4000 Monument Road to return a gift my son received for his birthday Sat. His grandma purchased him a car seat however it wasn’t safety equipped so I was returning the chair to get a more secure one. I was told they didn’t know why I couldn’t return without a receipt. I explained that it was gift and a fist receipt wasn’t provided. The cashier than told me “she didn’t know why I wasn’t able to return without a receipt” I called customer services and was advised that the item could be return however I would have to get someone else to do it. I don’t recall returning without a receipt because I always use my Target card. The principal about the situation is how rude PAULETTE WAS. She told me she was a manager when I asked to speak to one Bieber another employee there advised she was a “front end lead”. She slammed my id and Corp number on the counter I asked her to place it in my hand like I placed  it hers. She than advised that I didn’t give it to her so she’s not picking it up. She walked off leaving my other item on the counter and never returned. The original cashier returned and skipped right over me asked nice and politely to the Caucasian guy “how can I help you thanked him for his patience but never said another word as if I wasn’t standing there. I understand many people have it set in their heads that “BLACKS ARE GHETTO AND STEAL” but everyone isn’t like that. I work just like they do. On top of me spending so much money there on a reg. But I do know Target lost me as a customer and if his grandmother didn’t live out of town I would tell her to get her money back. I will be boycotting Target until their employees know how to treat their customers.

1150,0,"I purchase a lot of merchandise from target and have never had such bad customer service as I did today! I had to do a return and the two ladies were talking about me as if I was invisible!! Plus after I returned the items, she just threw them on the floor! No wonder merchandise gets damaged!! They both had such horrible attitudes!! I have worked in retail and to me there is no reason they should treat the people who shop in their stores the way that they do!! It’s no wonder most of America shops online, so that don’t have to deal with this!!"
2389,0,"I ordered items online for pickup. Target sent me a message that my order was ready to be picked up. When I got there one of the item was no longer available. So they gave me the option of having it shipped with free two day delivery. After accepting that, I realized that the delivery time was 5 days. There was no option online to cancel the order. I called customer care and they told me that I could refuse the item when it arrived. I told them I wasn't going to be home to refuse it. So they told me that they were unable to cancel the order and that I should wait for it to ship, then call them and they would reroute the shipment. It shipped a few minutes after getting off the phone with them. So I called them again. I was on the phone for over Two hours with them. I spoke to  person including one who hang up saying she couldn't hear me. After calling back and explaining my frustration to a lady, she told me she didnt have the authority to cancel the order and gave me a reference number for a department that could help. So, she transfered me and I was waiting for another 20 minutes. A man came on and after I explained everything to him, he told me that I would have to contact USPS myself. He did not even attempt to assist me. I will never purchase anything online from Target."
221,0,I will never shop at a Target again and will tell everyone I know to do the same. Selling boys clothes that make them look like girls. Outrageous !!! You have gone way too far recently regarding supporting this kind of nonsense. You are the problem in this country and are trying to ruin our children!!  DONE FOREVER WITH TARGET
1964,0,I am not sure who is packing Targets items for shipping....I have received 2 boxes now with many items broken. I had to go to the store and return from the first box and NOW I have to go back because the other box also had broken items in it. Shipping boxes are to big and they dont put enough padding in there to keep things from moving around. So think twice before ordering online. I have never seen anything like this. It was a waste of my time. I should have just gone to the store.
343,0,"I would have given Target a five-star rating, but because a couple years ago I found out that they refuse to put boxes out for Toys for Tots. If this has changed then I give it a five star. I don't know what it would hurt to help out these little children in a time of need like this. If anybody can correct me I will change my review."
507,0,"Ordering from Target for delivery and pick-up for me is a godsent, If I have a problem with anything I just go on-line, and they fix it right away.  There is a little bit of a wait at the counter if I go inside for a pick-up order, but I expect that."

You know when you know some's lying?  He said, Oh, the trucks were unloaded by 2:30, yeah, all gone.  I ended up buying less...a 43 inch TV for More money...just to get out of target and never come back! again."
53,0,"Target is indoctrinating kids into the transgender life style. These kids are too young to drink but Target thinks they are old enough to understand a decision to change their sex. The tuck friendly bathing suit and breast binding tops are a first step then comes the hormone drugs and surgery that mutilates their bodies. We all know it's part of the depopulation agenda, kids who mutilate themselves can't grow up to reproduce! If that wasn't bad enough the designer is a proud Satanist who had her breasts cut off and now thinks she's a he, mental illness! Pushing satanism on kids is beyond screwed up and sick. Let's not forget the pedo connection and the desperation to try and normalize it. We the people are sick and tired of it!

121,0,"So very disappointed. I went to Target's website to do 2 things: purchase a gift card for my son's birthday and to purchase a pair of shoes.  The shoes arrived a couple of days ago.  They gift card was cancelled - TWICE - and both cards had more than enough funds to make the purchase. When I received the first cancellation, I thought maybe they wanted me to purchase 2 cards with different denominations so the second time I purchased 2 gift cards with different denominations on a different credit card. The second transaction was cancelled as well.I called Target's customer service number and was told they would submit a ""ticket"" regarding the ""error"".  When I received a response from the ""ticket"" submission, it was a template email saying something to the affect of ""Sorry. Not our problem.""I then called Guest Services and was hoping I could get a better explantation as to what happened.  They reiterated what the template email stated.So.... I can get a pair of shoes from Target but I can't buy a gift card???Well, this is the last time I will be a Target customer and, apparently, Target doesn't care.  That's okay.  In today's competitive retail environment I will choose to spend my dollars elsewhere."

321,0,"DeliveryI ordered something which should have been here Wednesday.  Wednesday at 3 I checked tracking and it said inaccessible address(i have lived here for 10 years and have never had any kind of delivery problem from amazon, ups, door dash, flower delivery, etc...) I never got a phone call or any communication from the driver or anyone at Target saying they couldn't deliver my package.  I called and they said they had no way of checking on it because they had no idea what delivery carrier it was being delivered by...what??? I was then told they were using a new delivery service but the guy had no info. about it.  I asked to be transfered to someone higher up.  The higher up person proceded to tell me there is no new delivery service but that she has no idea who the carrier is on this order.  In fact, she asked me who the carrier was.  I told her I just ordered from you...i don't run the shipping department.   She said there was nothing that she could do because she had no way of contacting the carrier or the driver because she didn't know who they were. She said even if she did know who it was he could not be rerouted to try the delivery again that day and that she guaranteed it would be there on Thursday.  I told her this was a gift that i needed for tomorriw andcher exact response was ""you should wake up earlyvtomorrow and ho buy a backup gift.""  Are u kidding me with that???!!!   Thursday rolls around and I check tracking and the only information it says is at 11 AM that my package is out for delivery.   I kept checking the tracking throughout the day, because we live in age of porch pirates so i like to track deliveries closely, and there was no updated information.  From my experience with ups, amazon, fedex, etc...they don't deliver to my complex after 9 PM. So at 9 PM I went out to check and there was no package. Again called target and the woman could give me no information, there was nothing she could do and just suggested I wait till tomorrow....great customer service right?!  Woke up Friday and it had been delivered.  Target, u really need to do better with your delivery information.  This happened to be a gift that I was waiting for.  We also live in an age of porch pirates.  So forcthese two reasons alone, tracking and communication are extremely important.  Do better Target!"

496,0,"I bought an electric toothbrush and it was to be delivered 6 days later. Absurd, I know. Now it is three days past this deadline, seems Target used UPS to deliver, they in turn gave it to USPS to drop off at my house. No idea when I will finally receive the product. If I purchase something from Target I expect them to take responsibility for its timely delivery from the moment of purchase until the product is in my hands. That's what Walmart, Amazon etc does.

796,0,"I placed an online order on 06-23-21, with a promo of 2 day shipping.  After my order was placed, the estimated delivery date was 07-29-21.  That does not seem like 2 day shipping.  I called Customer Service on 06-28-21 to see if I could get my order shipped quicker, and was told that the request was sent, and I would receive an e-mail with an update if my request was approved.  No e-mail sent.  On 07-01-21 I called again to Customer Service to Cancel my order entirely and was told I could not cancel my order because it was not processed yet.  What a Line of Bull.  Wouldn't it make more since to cancel my order before it is process to ship?  I was told that when I receive a message that my order has shipped, then I could cancel my order.  This is a backwards policy.  It cost the company money for labor and material to process an order and get it shipped, when it doesn't cost anything to just cancel the order.

2532,0,"My first and last purchase from Target online led to customer service encounters that were so rude and dishonest that I had a flare-up of angina.  I will never attempt to do business with them again because of this.  My purchase was fairly small, but it was split up into three deliveries.  The two-day delivery took six days, but another package from the order was marked as 'delivered' when it was not, and it never came.  Target does not return money when it makes a mistake.  Customer service is non-existent, as I spent 90 minutes of my life on the phone with somebody apparently in Mexico who called himself Josh, and when I asked for his supervisor, Josh went away and came back and told me he was Frank.  The rule seems to be to repeat the same story over and over without ever doing anything to resolve a complaint.  What I got in return for the money I paid was a gift card that I certainly don't want.  Why should I buy anything else from a company that told me they had fulfilled an order when they didn't, and repeatedly insulted me afterward?  I tried also to get a different response by using the chat function.  The responses were just the same, and my gift card was already in the system.  There is nobody there with any power to do differently.  They are all helpless peons who have only one answer.  They will lie as suits them (one story was about a team of specialists being needed to do a Paypal return) but return over and over to the standard end point.  There is no honesty in their customer service, and this, to me, is far worse than somehow thinking a package is at my house when it was states away an hour or so earlier.  I was shouted at, and that should never happen in business.  My money was taken and they refuse to give it back.  I wish I had read reviews before ordering and I could have avoided this.  Save yourself the bother and continue ordering from Amazon."
257,0,"I’m a long time Target customer, but I may have to stop purchasing from them. I realize this may sound like a silly thing, but I’m an older woman and I’m handicapped. They always send everything I order together in a huge box that even the delivery guy has a problem carrying to my door. I struggle with every single delivery just getting it into my house, and then it’s so heavy that I can’t lift it up to a table or chair for opening. I have to lean over to open it and lift the items out individually. It blocks my ability to open my front door until it’s emptied. I have a bad knee and a bad back, and I re-injure myself with each Target delivery. No other stores have done this to me no matter how large the order. Only Target. Other stores seem to realize that they may have older customers who aren’t able to lift such heavy boxes and ship in several lighter boxes. Target has a box you can check if you want them to deliver/ship everything in one package and save $1. I only check the box if I’m not ordering anything heavy."

708,0,This has been my experience as an on-line purchase with Target. I purchased a few things on a weekday and one item came so fast I didn't even expect that to find it so soon as it did inside my home mailbox 📬 Speedy service and Loved the item. It was just what was seen in the photo and the quality was just as well what was seen in the photo. Maybe sometimes our devices that we are using might pick up a different coloring then the actual color but they do put the color name of the item in their system so this was just as it stated next to the item. I still have yet to receive the next few items but they are headed in this direction very soon now so I am very well pleased with my experience and their services. I don't order frequently but whenever I have I get the best service ever better than some places I have shopped at online so no complaints to you Target. Target is nice to have an online store you can depend on. Maybe it depends on your location where you live I don't know that but I have not experienced anything bad from them. Thanks to You Target!
2283,0,"Not knowing what the stores policy was for purchasing a hand bag, after calling I was told by the manager that all things of that sort were subject to be searched. My 17 year old daughter was asked if the handbag that she was purchasing could be searched, she doesn't understand why when she was purchasing something from the store that it was subject to be searched. In the self scan line all items are by weight! So I thought. She felt like she was singled out, I can't help the way she felt but I won't be sending her in by herself anymore"
2243,0,"I used to like Target years ago.  Great prices, nice things, and liked the 5% discount when using their card.  Lately, I’ve been ordering more online, 1) because I’m too busy to get to the store, and 2) they tend to be out of things I need.  I have to say that the packaging/ shipping is by far THE worst I have ever seen of any company I order from.  Today, I received the 4th disastrous shipment in about as many months.  For the second time, I received canned goods which were horribly dented.  They were actually packed well, with no damage to box.  I can only assume that they were that damaged BEFORE packing to send to me.  Who would pack an obviously damaged product??  Three of the six cans were really bad.  Yesterday I got two boxes of outdoor pathway lights.   They were not packaged in a bigger box- just the two separate boxes as if I bought them in the store.  Weird, but- whatever, except that they were taped shut, but someone had clearly sliced the tape and opened them!!  Not at all secure.  It appears that nothing is missing- but again, no common sense or care in packaging, to avoid that very thing.  Last month I bought a very pretty, heavy ceramic serving tray.  It arrived in a box which was about 3 times as big as was probably needed, with absolutely NO packing whatsoever.  No bubble wrap, no brown paper- just the loose bowl!!  I’ve never seen anything like it!  Guess what?  It was in a million pieces.  As soon as I picked up the box, I heard all the rattling.  I give up on this company for shipping.  I also had a horrible experience with customer service last year(like many other reviewers), and so was not interested in dealing with that again.  Done ordering online.  I may go into the store, if I have time, where at least I can be sure it will get to my house safely!  But Im so generally irritated that this is probably unlikely.  Things have really gone downhill at Target unfortunately."
6,0,"I needed to get a replacement order sent to me because the wrong color was sent. The person in the online chat said they couldn't do that, and gave me a number to call. that number went to a call center that tried to scam me out of all of my personal information and my credit card number, pretending they would send me a $100 gift card if I gave them all my information. Obviously a scam, and the person on the chat sent me there. They lied about not being able to send a replacement, because the next chat person I dealt with sent a replacement right away. So, there are people working for Target who are also working with scammers, and will send you to them. I tried to report this, but got a run-around and after 4 phone calls the last person I talked to told me they wouldn't investigate or even report it, so I guess Target doesn't care one bit that their customers are getting scammed. Obviously, I will never again buy anything from Target.com!"

Didn’t even offer for the inconvenience for all the driving back and forth. I spent at least 500 during the holidays at there store. No more!!! Wish I could show the pictures of it"
1360,0,Target.com that is. Its my go to shopping site. But i had a bad experience. Target stole my money 40 dollars to be exact 40 f***ing dollars excuse my language but they stole 40 dollarsni ordered a simple 10 dollar App store card and Target.com servers had an Issue that a an error went wrong and As I didnt have any mistakes i gave it another attempt to place my f***ing order but everytime i did it deducted even more up to $40 for 4 tries. I still haddnt gotten a refund as of now so I HATE ONLINE SHOPPING ITS SO UNRELIABLE IT SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED BRING MALLS BACK FROM THE DEAD BECAUSE ONLINE SHOPPING IS ALREADY AN UNRELIABLE WAY TO SHOP. I never got my order and no Emails that it went through at all. IVE BEEN BANNED FROM SEVERAL TARGETS IN THE PAST DUE TO COMPLAINTS WITH SERVICE INCREASED MY ANGER. THEY OWE ME 40 DOLLARS NOW THANKS TO THEIR STUPID SERVERS. And Another thing I had ordered something online but it came so LATE I GOT REFUNDED FROM SHIPPING.

2014,0,"I had an issue with an order, and then an issue when I did an online chat and then I called straight to the customer service line. I then requesting my opinion of the service I got and I left them know that I was not pleased at all and was very disappointed in Target, especially since I shop there all the time in store and online. Shortly after that I received a call from Target headquarters from a woman named Rebecca. She patiently listened to my complaint and to my explanation of the “customer service“ I did not receive. Call lasted a good half hour because I just kept talking and explaining. But she was very pleasant, listening, and took care of the issue immediately. She then followed up with me a week later on a Saturday after Thanksgiving to make sure I knew that she had followed up and, indeed, everything was taken care of and for me to have a nice holiday.My opinion of Target just skyrocketed knowing that a woman of Rebecca’s caliber was working at the headquarters."

I then decided to give Target another chance and again they were horrible.  I called ahead bc according to their website they had this item in stock, BUT I wanted to be sure before I drove all the way their and she reassured me they did.  I get there they have none so I asked for them to check in the back and she did, 10mins later I asked for her to check again as she rolled her eyes she radioed to the back and the girl immediately responds with “oh no we don’t”. I guess it was too hard for her to actually respond and let them know. I asked why their website says they have plenty and I showed her what I was looking at and she shrugged her shoulders and offered me no information.

I called & talked to 8 customer service agents; 4 of them were just a waste of time (including a male supervisor who insisted to have me go to the store when i couldn’t), another 4 were very helpful & understanding. Thank you to Briana, an agent who helped me place the order on the phone after it was canceled the first time time. Thank you to a male agent (who has a little of accent, but very understanding & sympathy) and his female supervisor. Also, thank you to a fraud agent who were very helpful & helped me placed the order on the phone  (after it was canceled the second time). Picking up at Lake Charles store, LA, the male representative on the phone was helpful, the young lady who brought the items were very pleasant.I should had got my items at around 1pm, but I finally got them at about 6 or 7pm instead, after many phone calls, I wasted a lot of my time, not impressed.I understand that you have to be mindful for the fraud, but you have to come with a better system that won’t hurt ordinary customers."

My Red Card was set on autopay and since I couldn't manage my credit union I switched my payment to my other bank since they're nationwide. Unaware that it didn't apply for the current month my payment failed to post. Target ended up putting 2 late payments on my account. I've written, called and filed a complaint with CFPB about this error. Target refuses to rectify the entries. I had same issue with Kohls and Walmart. They immediately fixed these late payments but Target is so greedy and unfair they will not fix it no matter what. I can't wait to pay this account off and close it even though it's one of my oldest cards. I refuse to give them my business after this."
2544,0,"I have always been a big fan of Target. However, my last experience was disappointing. First of all, when returning something someone bought you off your registry, you can only receive the funds on a gift card, which is completely normal. But then you can't use the gift card online unless the item being returned was bought online. They simply give you a merchandise card that can only be used in stores. I did my baby registry there and, at the end, I still needed to buy a necessary large item, which is only sold online. So, I returned a few items to help me pay for my big purchase. But most of the items were purchased in store, so the return was not helpful.Secondly, I signed up for the REDcard credit card because of the 5% off and they were running a $25 off of $100 purchase promotion. I should've read the fine print more carefully, but after I received my coupon and card, I realized Target doesn't allow you to use more than one coupon/promotion at a time. I was already using the 15% off for purchasing items on my registry. Thirdly, after collecting all the gift cards I could, returning the items I don't need right away, and waiting for my $25 off coupon, I finally went to check out and, unfortunately, you can't use more than 4 gift cards per order. I never thought I'd be leaving Target a bad review. Maybe they'll pay attention and change something."

She made no effort to chastise or even correct the little young white security employee; who despite only few say 5 or 6 black customers exiting thr store and less than 10 total were in the entire.store as far as I could see. The young man only required us.few black folk to  right of the customers to produce our receipts. One mother had obviously placed her receipt in her wallet and had to root around for it. Whilst she did that the security employee must have waved on at least 4 or 5 white customers. Another black family came to exit and he asked them to show their receipt and then a few 2 or 3 white customers exited before me. My turn came the young man asked for my receipt I refused; walked out and went right back in to complain the store manager.  This store seemingly has a past practice of this very thing. I was disgusted!!! I just got off the phone with Target customer care folks they took my statement and gave me a case number. I left all my contact info waiting to see if Target is gonna do anything if not I intend to seek support from wherever to ensure Target does not just ignore this!!! Enough is enough!!!!"

According to EFW, they don't know when the TV will be delivered.Called Target and the customer service rep basically said ""What did you expect?""This is the absolute last time I order from Target.com.  Shameful, just plain shameful."
2208,0,"I ordered a pair of shoes online for in-store pickup. According to the website there was one pair left in my size. When I added the shoes to my cart and attempted to pay I was required to sign in or create an account. There was no opportunity to check out as a guest. I must have created an account on a  prior occasion because it hit on my email address and would not let me proceed until I had signed in or changed my password. The whole process took a ridiculous amount of time. After finally meeting the requirements I placed my order and  was told it would be available soon. Then I got an email stating the shoes were unavailable because ""someone grabbed the last one."" There needs to be an option to check out as a guest. This is ridiculous."
2260,0,I read the many negative reviews and I  have decided to write of my recent experience with customer service.  I called Target.com many times for information regarding a purchase that was under warranty but no longer within the 90 day return agreement. This product did not offer the extended warranty. I also received the run around like the other review mentioned .  I found customer service was simply unable to provide accurate information regarding the purchase or how to contact the manufacturer. It was annoying that it took 3 phone calls for them to just say That!

159,0,"I want to give Target a zero. Please include a zero on the rating chart. I am done shopping at Target as long as you have a PRIDE section and support these immoral falsehoods. Kids are impressionable, too, and you are leaving them exposed to an unhealthy and immoral sexual lifestyle. Also, pay attention that the vast majority of this country that is disgusted and furious. They boycotted Bud Light and now Target. Target, keep out of politics and get the PRIDE out of you store and corporate policies. I am very upset with your promotion of tuck bathing suits, the transgender agenda, and promoting it has s natural, healthy lifestyle. Transgendered people are less than 1 percent of the population in the USA. So why are you turning your backs on the majority of your customers to support a tiny minority of people who are grooming vulnerable children and young people. The overwhelming majority believes transgenderism is causing a lot of problems in our young people who lack the emotional maturity to understand exactly what is going. They are being brainwashed. For  starters, there are only 2 sexes, says science, and the world knows that. It doesn’t matter what one thinks, the chromosomes can not be changed. I ask you to donate a permanent section in the store  to veterans  - so many are homeless, living in poverty, with mental  illness, alone and without support. I would gladly make purchases for them whether individual serving food packets, new underwear and socks, blankets and clothing.Be proud to be patriotic and support them! The majority of our elderly live in poverty, are lonely, and feel forgotten. Visit a nursing home and see the despair. Then help out  - perhaps raise funds to hire companions to visit.  Understaffed, the nursing home aids don’t have time. I saw it with my own eyes visiting loved one.  Whatever you do, get out of this PRIDE business and do something that brings awareness to the real issues in our country. Chose a non political issue we  can get behind. Pay attention to the comments here. You are losing customers and like me they can easily shop somewhere else."
1986,0,Midland store is a great store... they employ people with disabilities. An example is someone only had one lag and was in a wheel chair but he worked there till he died... yet we do have some bad times there and say we would not go back we always end up going back because of that!!!
303,0,I ordered for Target's same day delivery. I did not get almost half of my big order and wasn't notified. Real delivery companies notify and see about a substitution.
1810,0,"I am not the type to be overly sensitive or easily offended usually. I was slightly astonished when I first saw the Target commercial on their work with The Honey Pot company. To allow someone in a commercial to make comments specific to one gender/race is so sad considering the ""climate"" in America right now. Shame on Target for allowing this to air and shame on Beatrice Feliu-Espada for perpetuating the racism in this country. I will not be buying her products nor will I be shopping at Target."
1395,2,"i have been shopping at target since i was little, it was my favorite store to go to with my parents, now i shop there with my toddler and i love it, however i do NOT like the customer service at ALL. very disappointed in target it’s like they don’t even care anymore i’ve made complaints about multiple stores with associates acting like they have no clue where anything is at the store, barely wanting to help me, and being very rude. lazy and irresponsible!! in the electronics section there was a lady chewing gum had her mask tucked under her face, was on her phone and it took her like 5 minutes to help me out!??? plenty more terrible experiences i’ve had and at multiple of nearby locations i am beyond shock with the type of customer service i receive. this is your job this is what your supposed to do! no smiles no warm welcome i think i’m just going to go back to walmart or shop somewhere else i’ve really had it... hate to do this because i love target but they need new management or something people that actually care about Target and giving at least OK or DECENT customer service!"
814,0,"I just ordered a few things on target to be picked up didnt realize that they sent one of my items to another store. As soon as it submitted it and got the confirmation I noticed different stores, went to cancel the order for the different store and it wouldnt let me. Reached out to customer service who told me I cant because it was ""processing"" come on I just ordered it. Now I have to wait 3 business days for my order to get closed and probably 5 more before the money is released from my bank. Im done with Target terrible!!! Just to cancel within minutes of an order should not be an issue they are whack. Ill take my business to Walmart"
2599,0,"Dont ever order online, not only will u never recieve ur order but they will not issue a refund either. They make the post office hold ur order and claim u have to wait for a refund until the item is returned, which if the post office is holding it u never get ur money back. Their customer service sucks and they are absolutely horrible. Hope they get shut down cause what they do is unacceptable. Just absolutely horrible. Never again. Dont ever order from them!"
2017,0,This store sucks if I was you I wouldn't buy nothing from this store you go to buy a phone and then your phone stops working because your battery is all messed up in it and they won't even replace the battery they say because it's inside of the phone the phone that it won't work that they can't replace the battery that's this stupid phone is only 3 months old and they can't replace a battery that's highway robbery number one number two I wouldn't buy a phone through them no matter what even if my butt was on fire and I needed it and I'm canceling my policy with Consumer Cellular too because of them
2211,0,Target is absolutely killing it in the clothes department! As a thicker female who’s on a journey of weight loss and health it can be super discouraging and disappointing to try on something you think will fit and doesn’t even stand a chance getting on. The last two trips I took to target buying clothes for Hawaii I had amazing luck. I even found a pair of jeans and two pairs of jean shorts which is the hardest thing for me to find. So keep it up target I’m super impressed and will be back. I didn’t even buy from the plus size. That was just women’s
1567,0,I will no longer shop at Target in Cheektowaga N.Y or any Target store location. I'm tired and fed up with being racially profiled and followed when i shop at their store! I've noticed it at least on 3 or for 4 separate occasions. 1 occasion was with my sister so it's not just me. It's gotten to the point were it is painfully obvious! This has been going on for years and they refuse to do anything about it. I and anyone else that has shopped at their business should not feel like a criminal while browsing for items for purchase! Im done with Target!
2413,0,Target has to be the worst store in the United States since they have started having unisex restrooms My family will never shop there anymore
2082,0,I order 3 pairs of wrangler straight fit pants. Why on earth would target split this into 3 different shipments and charge me an additional $21 per shipment. The first shipment arrived and they are not the right pants. Target you suck
347,0,Target has the best pick up experience. Better than any other stores that offers pickup
1230,0,"I was online and signed in to my account after waiting all night for the release of the Xbox series X. I had it added to my cart it gave me the full price after tax I changed my card info hit confirm purchase and it sent me back to my cart and said it was empty. When I tried to add it to cart again it said I have the maximum amount of this item I could order. After calling and speaking with guest services this is what I was told: because you changed your payment method it deleted it from your cart and gave it to somebody else that was faster. This is absurd, people can't just walk up and take the last thing from my cart at the store it was already in my cart on my account, this never would have happened with Amazon or Wal-Mart. 1st time I have ever tried target for anything and it will be the last, because of my time wasted by this companies stupid system it was guaranteed everywhere else was sold out. I will highly recommend to anybody not to use target as a service if they plan to receive the items they want, way better options out there"
2482,0,Great store!  Love their products.
947,0,"I’m a big Target shopper, for me is super convenient to shop for groceries, cleaning supplies and more, but there is an inconvenience at the checkout since there are not many registers open and customers are force to use the self checkout. It looks that the Target strategy is focused on individual small purchases."

1523,0,Pamela at the Huber Heights Ohio Target is rude and feels she can target Seniors. I spent almost $400 tonight and will never spend another cent at Target.  Any Target. She thinks she’s the only person under stress at this time of Covid19.  I let Customer Service know how she spoke to me and it was really a joke to them. Shame on you Target.  Come to think of it is must be standard operating procedure at this store.  I don’t see many seniors in the store.  Guess we don’t fit you profile.
397,0,In 7/22 I never received a statement from Target and pd $47 two days late.  They charged me a late fee plus service fee so sent a letter explaining I never rec'd a statement.  Meanwhile they charged 2 more late fees + so I paid $124+ to stop the thievery.  My letter was answered with a note telling me to call them. Very displeased with their poor business practice and shabby treatment.  Never buy from them again.
2197,0,"Went to the Target La Mesa, Grossmont Center (San Diego) - they are now charging you for bags that are of a quality as when they were free. Gone are the thick bags that could hold a lot for people who forget there bags in the car or at home. I know it's been a couple of years since the bag thing was started in CA, however if you're going to switch to cheap bags again at least don't charge for them as a courtesy for how much I spend in your store. And the comment about the 2 day taking longer is true for me also."

1439,2,"Curbside pick up is done quicker than anywhere else, can't complain. Only knocked a star off because sometimes their prices are on the higher end. Once I found an item that was in the clearance had a price of $30, went to check out and it rang up at $100. They did some research and unfortunately someone placed that on their by mistake, yet they still honored it. You won't find that anywhere else. Also they will literally take any returns."

636,0,"#Target emailed me to go to the store to resolve the issue with the return of the TV.  First of all, they discriminated against me for being hispanic.  They treated me as a thief, when I bought the tv because of their policy, I couldn't open it, they took it directly to my car.  So I have to trust them that the merchandise in the box is correct, but it was not like that and they kept my money and also discriminated against me for being a hispanic."
12,0,"I've been trying to find a better place to order cookbooks since Amazon ships with zero packing material and books always arrive damaged and dirty; Barnes & Noble is too expensive at full retail price with no discounts; Target's books were decently priced so I was hoping they might be the answer. Well almost 2 weeks later I still have not received what I ordered, it's one delay after another. What a hassle"
1965,0,"Do yourself a favor and never order online from Target. They should be ashamed of themselves at the holiday time and the route they choose to deliver purchases. It has to be one of the most ineffective way to ship an order. Unfortunately I purchased items  that needs to be delivered early to a under privileged children’s distribution center. I placed the order on December 1st. I receive notification that it shipped on Wednesday, December 4 and I would receive it by December 13. It is now been postponed until the 16th when it’s right in my back door. I’m not allowed to pick it up,it transfers from FedEx to the post office. Now gifts that are supposed to be delivered to children on the 15th are not going to get there. Shame on you Target .A package starts in Alabama goes to Tennessee,Wyoming,Champaign Illinois,Indiana and now back to Illinois. How is that cost effective."

2576,0,"I came to Target to buy 4 cans of Lotrimin.  I had 4 manufacturer coupons printed from the Lotrimin site.  I additionally added about 50.00 worth of other I hadn't planned on buying.  I followed Target policy and the coupons policy.  (Target only allows 4 coupons for the same product and Lotrimin only allows the same coupon to be used 4 times in one purchase).  I get to the checkout, the coupon doesn't scan- Lotrimin coupons have a history of not scanning.  In the past, clerks just over-rided it through.  This clerk calls a low level manager over.  Out of the kindness of his heart he allowed one coupon to go through.  I called customer service from the parking lot.  It seemed everything was ok and the customer service agent told me he couldn't do anything for me unless I was in the store.  Luckily I was still in the parking lot.  35 minutes later, I still hadn't had anything accomplished but a 5.00 gift card which doesn't help for me purchasing the Lotrimin right now.  I had to hand my phone over to the low level manager and waste minutes on my phone and time in my life.  After all of this I was told that when a coupon doesn't ring, management doesn't have to take it.  I wasted 35 minutes for that.   So, now the Cary Target on Walnut St gets a bad Trustpilot review, gets blasted on my facebook page, I returned 50.00 worth of merchandise, and they lost another 20.00 with the lotrimin sale.   I won't shop at this Target again, and as soon as my accumulated gift cards are used up, I won't shop Target again.  I have been an avid Target shopper, have their debit card and spend several hundred a month there in groceries and other odd items.  My question to Target, was this worth the 4.50 in coupon and the young manager self satisfaction in saying ""no?""   You lost a customer and in a tight market where you are not doing as well as you would like, was it worth it?"
1451,0,"What has happened to Target?  They are ALWAYS out of merchandise. This has only been exacerbated by Covid-19. Before Covid they were out of everyday basics every time I went in the store.  I used to be a Sr Buyer at Target and instocks we’re measured Nd we were reviewed on them. What happened?  turnover must be more 8mportant than instocks now. As Bob Ulrich, the prior CEO used to say- you can5 sell what you don5 have. My go to stores are now Costco and Trader Joe’s. I go to Target only in energancies."

I will never step foot in another target again"
1205,0,"I ordered 2chairs from target.com 7/26 2days went by i didn't receive a tracking # so I emailed Target.com inquired about the tracking # never received a response.  I did the chat with them was told everything was on time I would receive them by aug 18-20 even gave me reference #. On the 18th I called to check on a time of arrival, was told it never shipped and they were out of stock and didn't know when they would be in, I had already got rid of what I had to make room for these chairs. Spoke to supervisor was told I would get a full refund, I told them I didn't want to shop there anymore(1st time shopping there) I get an email telling me my refund would be on a target gift card, I called again and was told they would take care of it, I would get it back on my pay pal. I ordered 2 chairs from another company to replace these. A couple of days later I get an email from FedEx telling me I would be recieving the chairs I ordered from target, called target they said no it was a mistake they were working on my refund ignore the email. A couple of days later I recieved 1 of the chairs from target,called them back to ask what was going on was told by a supervisor that  they intercepted the other chair but I could keep the one I recieved at no charge for all the trouble and I would still receive my refund. Ok I've contacted target several times and have recieved the run around it has now been 3months since this nightmare has begun and I still have not received my refund and the chair they sent me ws defective to boot the leg doesn't tighten. $346.96 to be exact, is not a drop in the bucket for us, I am shocked that they would treat customers this way. Hoping to get my refund soon."
842,0,"I am a long time Target customer.  But re my last order, I had to make numerous calls to Target to try to get my order corrected.  I was repeatedly told something that did not happen.  I was finally told by a supervisor I would receive an adjustment.  I agreed to that. However, that never happened and just now I was told by another supervisor that there were no notes in the file and basically that I must be making it up.  She was snide and unhelpful.  I would rate the Target customer service lower than 1 star if I could.  They don't care about their customers and they just lost a long time one."
871,0,"Target.com is amazing with the best return policy. Any time I've had an issue, they were kind, polite, personable, and very helpful in fixing the issue. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because their face to face employees are so-so. It's like a grab bag dealing with the f2f--you never know what you're going to get! lol Usually they're at least helpful, though sometimes you get rude people who don't know what they're doing, which is why the managers are there. The managers ALWAYS make things better, so grateful for them! lol! :)  I also dislike the quality of their clothing and jewelry so won't be buying that again, but everything else I've bought either held up well or was refunded in full so I'm pretty happy with them and will continue to be a customer. Pro tip-- If you have any issues, use their chat to get your refund. You won't have to drive to the store to handle the issue and they're very nice and quick for a resolution via chat!"
1258,0,"My area target is really trying the best they can through all of this covid stuff.  Store is clean but of course help is scarce.  Waiting in checkout line is long. Cashiers are losing their patience with customers.  Younger workers need to say ""thank you"" ""can I help you?"" And ""have a nice day.""  I would have gotten fired with the attitudes these girls have.  Human resources needs to retrain.  Sorry.  Still shopping there but hope they get it together before christmas.  I am not a Walmart shopper."
1936,0,"I am a long time Customer of Target. Today, after being directed to service in one area, I was left standing there, then took myself to a self service counter after being ignored - then needed a bag of which I was ready to pay for. Rudely spoken to about costing 15cents then handed change without so much as a have a good day or making eye contact. What has happened to your store?. Any wonder people are shopping online at stores who do care about their customers. Seriously, Target - get a grip."
736,0,I ordered online used my credit card-they added an additional $4 to what it was supposed to be-this has happened several times. Also if you use PayPal and need a refund they give you a gift card -they don’t refund back to PayPal. Many times I have not gotten 1-2 things in my order-and now very slow shipping again. I like to shop online here but they are so inconsistent that I probably won’t anymore.
315,0,"Very poor policy on purchasing and replacing a damaged item online! I ordered a crockpot (on sale) to use for Christmas and while it arrived on time (12/24/22), it was broken. I notified Target that day and was given the option of a refund or a replacement. I opted for a replacement. I was then sent several request for surveys on how the customer service handled this - which I did not answer because it was not a completed transaction. I had not received a tracking number from them on a replacement crockpot being sent even though there was a message in my order account about it, so I finally called them today to ask if they could help track it for me. The agent told that me that since I had already requested a replacement before I could only be refunded my money or could order a new one and then turn around and call them to get the sales price. What??? At this point I was pretty frustrated. When I asked why I had not been sent another one or why another one could still not be sent the agent could not give me an answer!! I did tell him to advise his upper management to come up with some plausible answer for this situation. Ridiculous!"

2546,0,"If I could give a zero, I WOULD! Terrible service! Also, how does a corporation this large have so little staff that it takes 10-20 minutes to get someone on the phone for a target.com order? Ordered a crib in June, delivered to me splintered and damaged. Asked for a replacement and told it was on its way and would arrive August 7th. At 4am the next morning I received an email that I would be issued a refund because the crib was no longer stocked. It is now August 13th. I’m having a baby in a week and I called to find out where my refund is. Apparently you have to call and ask for it! It will be here in about 7 days I was told. Never again Target.com. Never again."
2353,0,"Ladies, if you like your friends and relatives, don't register for your baby shower at Target. If you don't like them then by all means, go ahead, because it's an excellent way to torture them. I remember once going to Babies R US to get a gift from a registry and it took almost three minutes to find what we wanted. At Target it took us two trips to different Targets, printing out the registry twice, and we still had to get an employee to find the items, which she had trouble finding, too! At the first Target (Rossford, Ohio) we went to there were bare spots on the display walls where clearly they had sold out of whatever was there and hadn't restocked, as well as bare shelves. Besides which, the baby section was quite small. Clearly we weren't going to find anything there so we went to a different Target (Monroe St. Toledo, OH). This time we took a printed list of the registry. The baby section was larger and better stocked but really unorganized, with items all over the place rather than stocked according to similar items (blankets were in two different aisles, for example, and socks were three different places). I couldn't find anything on the registry list and looked for help but the three employees in the area were far more interested in having a conversation than helping customers and were annoyed that I asked for help. Eventually we were told that if we went back to the front of the store and printed out the registry there we would have the item numbers and it would be easier to find the items. When we returned to the baby section the employee that said she would help was no where to be found-- of course. Eventually we tracked her down and she started looking for things only to discover that they weren't in stock. Finally we got a few items and left but with a really bad impression of Target. They don't seem to know how to manage their stock, which is incredible because, you know-- computers. Their employees have no interest in assisting customers. Their aisles, sections, and products are poorly organized, and it is way too complicated and difficult to buy from a gift registry. You would think that a store of this size would have figured out gift registries and customer service by now but clearly they have a lot to learn. It is not a good store at all."
2543,0,I order my child a back pack online it came as a bundle of many other products with it on 8/2/18  says it will be delivered by 8/13/18 it’s now 8/16/18 and I have received 6 emails saying my order is gonna be delayed to 5 different dates this morning I received that it was delayed again to be delivered 8/22/18  I called and spoke to customer service and they stated it’s been delayed because they are currently out of stock of the item I order than proceeds to tell me that once they get the new shipment my order will be shipped and delivered now it’s the evening I look at my emails to find out they have cancelled my order that I’ve waited for since the beginning of the month.

I don’t know why they put the pool like they had it but they didn’t. But this didn’t happen 1 time it happened again different pool I waited 4 days then it was cancelled again!!

577,0,If I could give negative stars I would. I placed an order online for the first time trying to save time before vacation. Worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life. Said my package would arrive Friday I was suppose to leave for vacation Saturday morning. So I track it Friday never got an email saying it would be delayed. The. They say oh sorry it’s showing up Saturday but Marco promises me he flagged it and will show up Saturday at 8am . So I wait until 10:30 am track the package again and now it says Monday. One lady wouldn’t even answer me and tell me when it was going to show up and hung up on me. Had to call back just to cancel my order. This is how you treat new online customers .  No thanks this service is horrible don’t use them just save yourself time and go to the store
318,0,"Omg, I try not to use profanity, but my experience with my first online order with Target was nothing but a s#@! show. I placed the order at 7am with a scheduled delivery between 9 and 10. Then it was postponed. Twice. Then the item was out of stock, but I couldn't cancel the order. Then I received 3 other texts that they were picking up my order for delivery. Then a final text that my item was sold at 10am and no longer in stock. I will NEVER shop here online again!"

1236,0,"I have been shopping at Target store in San Diego miramesa and always have a great customer service experience. Not to mention the prices are extremely competitive and the in shop experience is very smooth. Recently they started Driveup service after COVID, which in my opinion is totally unbeatable by any competition. Everytime I have been there my experience with associates have been extremely pleasant. They are prompt and friendly. I am a member of Amazon Prime and also shop through instacart but this free Driveup service beats everything hands down. The leadt I could do is tell others about what Target has to offer. An extremely satisfied and wowed customer."

A little after 5, I received an email stating that they are sorry, but my order was canceled due to a ""technical"" issue on their end. I made several calls to the stores, to the delivery company, and to the Target office. No one was able to figure out the issue. I was told to reorder, that there was probably a glitch and the next order should go through. So I reordered and again, received another confirmation, and then after waiting for another 2 hours, my order was again canceled for a ""technical"" problem. Again, after several calls- and so much time on hold- I was again told that they did not know why this happened. I share this because this is unacceptable --there is no way I will ever order from them again. They need to figure this out!"
2005,0,"I ordered Christmas gifts cyber Monday because of the deals they offered. When I checked tracking I noticed target rerouted my packages to my ex husbands old house from 4 years ago. This address hasn’t been used since. When I called to fix the situation they would not help me. Their resolution was for me to cancel my orders with the deals and reorder with out the deals. Of coarse that is not an option for me. Then after getting off the phone with them, I received a random email stating they canceled all my orders anyways! So after calling again and an hour of beating around the bush they continued the order to the house that I did not even live at!! They refuse to help me. Now I have to drive an hour away and close my business to pick up packages on three separate days. This whole experience is very very very peculiar, unprofessional and has become more of a hassle to deal with. Even the supervisors refused to help me with a problem that they caused!I will never ever use target to order online again and I will tell every single customer that walks through my business the horrible experience I have had to deal with. Super disappointed Target, you need to tighten up! I’ll stay with Amazon."
2385,0,"Target online is a huge letdown. I ordered two bikes to arrive in the store on Dec. 14. On Dec. 14th, I received an email that the delivery was delayed and they were expected on Dec. 18th. I was advised to expect  another email when the items arrived in the store. Having heard nothing, I called customer service on Dec. 21st only to learn the order was canceled because one bike was out of stock and the other could not be delivered before Christmas. I was NOT notified of this cancellation, and my Christmas plans are now ruined. It's only Amazon from now on."
1025,0,I just had an amazing experience at the Target on Ellsworth in Aurora Colorado. The store manager Gene Ann was absolutely fantastic! I needed help fining an item and she was kind as can be to me. She listened to me and was very patient. She even took the time to call me back when I  asked about my product. I highly recommend shopping here. It is friendly and fun and easy to get the help you need!!!! Five stars!!!!!! Thank you Target.
2336,0,"I go to the target at city point in downtown Brooklyn.....honestly, some people just shouldn’t be in the customer service industry.....1st the good things.....the store is conveniently located, usually pretty clean and have “some of what I need” However, every time I go into this store the workers there are all engaged in their own conversations, good luck getting help....they are not very friendly or willing to help instead they more or less make u feel like you are bothering them.... and I’ve only encountered about 3 workers who seem nice one in particular, Melissa, she is truly a worker who seems to like helping she is friendly kind and always has a smile and she always remembers me (I tend to look for her when I go there)And finally.....the main reason I chose to post a review (cause I can deal with everything else) but the Starbucks in the store.....I just don’t understand the nastiness and attitudes of the workers for no reason, like u can see the disdain on their face as they see u coming (like I’m really really sorry I want a coffee and I’m bothering u) don’t work there you ruin the whole day and experience of shopping in target for me and others as u have ur friend sitting at a table talking to u as u work, I’m so sorry I interrupted ur convo. usually (not all the time, I’m satisfied with my visit in the store) until I come to get a coffee or cake pop for my kid....and I’m super nice (and I work in service industry)."
1193,0,We order from here a lot as well. Pretty fast delivery.
2145,0,"I used to love Target.  I have no idea if it is just my local store or indicative of an overall corporate problem, but the quality of the store and the customer service is beyond disappointing.   The store is always a mess, the lines are long, the customer service poor, store pick up orders not ready, shelves not stocked, shelves not labeled properly.  One if the people online in front of me commented that it's no wonder that Amazon is doing so great.  They need some decent management and some additional staff if needed."
2603,0,I ordered online for a registry picked up in store 20 minutes later. It was super easy and efficient. I reccommend to anyone.
2420,0,"This review was disallowed on Yelp so am posting it here.I worked in home care and took a client to the University Heights Target to buy presents for her grandkids. This Target is conveniently located near the major intersection so you can enter from either street.  The covered parking is awesome, my car is safely protected from the elements while I shop, and the store is wheelchair accessible which adds to the convenience of use.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be back shopping."
669,0,"Package came with no packing in it and items damaged and leaking fluids. Running out of the box. Used PayPal but their policy is to issue a giftcard for their mistakes. Not refunding money back into the PayPal account. Order from a reputable company that has previous experience with shipping. This must be a new concept to Target. Shipping, because they definately do not know how."
645,0,I didn't get a deal for an order that should've been applied so I talked to customer support and I got a person named Luis and they were very helpful and I got my refund.
466,0,"So, I love Target in and of itself... But I ABSOLUTELY HATE CANNOT STAND IT IS HORRIBLE the website/app. It's slow and glitchy and as someone that does 90% of her shopping online, I am pissed. They updated the site/app and since then it's been awful. Target. Get it together. It takes me 4x as long to shop online with you than it does with Walmart and I am not patient when in a hurry. I'd rather spend money at Target, but I'm not wasting an hour of my time trying to get my cart sorted out."
1342,0,"We went to their Milton, GA store. It was clean, the service was great, prices and selection good. And a special shout out to Anne-Marie at the register who was especially helpful and signed us up for customer rewards - save that 5%! Her friendly demeanor and fantastic attitude made our day!"
2499,0,"First time ordering on-line at Target, dresser and nightstand.  Husband started to put together nightstand and it was a dark solid color all over rather than the light colored parquet that was pictured.  Called customer service and was sent to the Philippines where a woman got return all mixed up sending request to UPS and USPS for the same pick up of the nightstand.  Call was disconnected after spending a lot of time trying to explain the difference between UPS and USPS to her.  Called back again to have them pick up dresser.  Talked at length and got nowhere with the second person.  Call was disconnected again.  I called a third person and explained the situation AGAIN and that person told me to call the next day.  In all, I spent 2 hours on the phone talking to three ""not a clue"" people, hung  up twice and still not resolved.  Finally thought to take packages (weighing 140 pounds and two 40 pound) to local store.  Easy and friendly to deal with locals.  Worst customer service for on-line products and no quality control.  Never again!"
2028,0,Target is located in a convenient area for my but does lack the best price point and selection
177,0,Best store in the world! Great service and friendly people.
2156,0,"My wife had an old target account with an original balance of under $200. We did not receive any bills or letters in the mail. 2 years later and my wife gets served papers saying Target is suing her for not just the original balance of under $200, but for $735 + court costs.That’s right, Target will sue their customers. Target USED to be one of my favorite places to shop. I would come to the store twice a week and we would make major purchases there.Never. Again. I hope suing a customer for chump change is worth never getting a cent from us again."
2261,0,Target Corporate customer service sucks..I have been trying to get money credited back to my credit card for 2 months and they keep telling me it's a system error and no help what's so ever...I have been hung up on twice and talked to several different people...worse company ever..will never shop there again
883,0,"A book is sold by Target in their “Christian Life” section that includes a “prayer” written by a black female professor who asks God to help her “hate White people.”  The title of the book is “A Rhythm of Prayer: A Collection of Meditations for Renewal” and is written by Sarah Bessey. It contains passages from a number of authors and is selling for $14.87 on Target’s website. It was published in February, 2021, and was a New York Times bestseller.  The passage in the book is entitled, “Prayer of a Weary Black Woman” written by author Chanequa Walker-Barnes, Ph.D.  Apparently, Target has no issue with this so I'm done with Target.  Good-bye."
687,2,I made a payment of $250 at a Target location in Brooklyn. Got my receipt walked to register. Money wasn't on Targer card. Paid with bank debit. Once home called to complain. Then realized I paid $250. Which shows. But only $210 went for payment. Never received $40. Now Target won't give credit. Their crooks!!!!!
421,0,"To target and public!! Went into store to buy 2 DVD's, no one working in electronics dept. Asked 2 people working in an isle if anyone was working in the electronics dept. to be asked do you want me to get someone to help U? I said back (no I only wanted to see if someone was in that dept?!?) I really told the one helper that was a stupid question, (She said in turn oh now you are calling me dumb) I waited for someone to come for electronics dept but NOONE showed up over next 15 min. I could have stole the register or anything in that dept! Very frustrating not being able to get help and I take it Target does not need the sale???????????"
2132,2,"Really just a terrible experience. 2K20 was preordered on August 18th, at which I was promised I would recieve the game 2 days after the release date (Sept. 8th). For those who know, time is everything when it comes to 2k. $100 was spent on this game with hopes of receiving it on time, but I am still waiting! I called to see what they could do and they simply said they had no more copies... Why let people preorder if you knew you didn’t have enough. I always have a terrible time at Target and the experiences just keep getting worse."
2513,0,"I worked at a Target in the United States, and I still go to this store often to buy things. Target is like a quirky version of Wallmart that has stuff with crazy designs and is a tiny bit pricier. If your looking for something that is cool looking for your home without being too expensive, Target is the place to go. However, if you want the cheapest consumer goods money can buy, go to Wallmart or some other store."
449,0,"I’ve always loved target customer service but today really made me upset. I wanted to buy a present for a friend and went on the app to look for something. I saw this SpongeBob Krusty Krab hat I wanted to buy and it said that it was available in stores. I went to the stores, it wasn’t in stock. I asked an employee to help me find it, thinking maybe that I couldn’t find it. She couldn’t find it either and said to try doing a pickup in store since it showed the hat was in stock online. (BTW this isn’t the employees fault). I ordered the hat and was happy that I had finally gotten the gift after running around for 30 minutes. It said it would be ready by 2 hours. After maybe 1.5 hours it says the hat is not in stock. I’m very upset by this bc I plan to see this friend today and then I don’t see him for a month+. My time was wasted and plans too. Please fix the target app."

176,0,"The only reason I gave 1 star is because 0 wasn't an option.I've been a card holder at Target for over 22 years.  I've never had the kind of trouble I've had in the last 2 years with them.  My card is in good standing and I owed nothing on it.  First, about a year an a half ago I was buying something for my granddaughter. My card was declined.  I used my debt card to pay. When I got to my car I called to find out why my card was declined.  The person on the other end of the phone said it was because my card was old and they could send me a new one. Why they didn't send me a new one before I needed it, I have no idea.  I received the new card a few days later.  I activated it and off we go. No problem.  Then, last month, I went in to buy a gift.  I went to use my card, again, it was declined.  This is getting frustrating.  I used a different card and left the store.  I called from my car to find out why it wasn't working again.  The person said the company had tried to mail me something.  The correspondence was returned to them as undeliverable.  They had the right address. I figured maybe a new mail carrier was lazy.  Got it resolved.......so I thought.  Never did I receive any mail from them.  Then today, I get an alert through my credit report, one of my accounts had been closed.  Low and behold, Target canceled my card after 22 years.  No warning, no email, no mail, nothing, just canceled.  I called to find out ""what the heck"".  It was canceled because of inactivity.  I explained, I've tried to use it. It gets denied when I try.  No balance due, no bad history.  They checked my history and saw where I tried to use it but couldn't.  Their response was, well you could have tried again after you left.  I explained I don't live close.  I don't go into Target all the time.  I am not even by Target.  Their response was, ""Well, there is nothing we can do.  You can open a new account."" Why would I do that? They just shut down an account I had for 22 years.  That will affect my credit score negatively.  Now you want me to apply for a new card? That would also ding my credit score.  Pass.Target, you have lost me for good.  You did me wrong and won't even attempt to correct it."
1021,0,Great customer service when returning a item online
1924,0,Purchased a vacuum online for instore pickup. The item was listed as instock at store. When I opened the item I quickly found out it was a return open box item. Target did not state this was a return. The vacuum had hair and carpet fibers in the brush and under the filter. And the inside of the canister was dusty and  had red and green glitter in it. My son also received a play station 4 ecards membership for xmas that we can't get activated. Called the call center and that was a 40min waste of time. Still trying to activate. All a round disappointed. Not a Target shopper due to other issues in the past. Won't  be returning to target don't want to waste my time and money like this
271,0,"I ordered an Apple Watch Series 8 from Target. When the package came, there was no Apple Watch inside, just an empty Apple box. Customer service is an absolute nightmare and they won't direct you to anyone who can actually help. All they say is that they investigated the delivery and it was successful. I would not order anything expensive from the website, as you could be throwing your money away."
1135,0,"Duck your head and beware! Went to the Asheville South to buy my son’s dog some dog food. He really likes the Blue brand for senior dogs. Having shopped online to see what I’d be buying and at what the cost would be I felt confident I knew what I would be buying. I found the bags of Blue Senior and saw the price w as $4 cheaper than that which most stores advertised. I like a deal as well as anyone. On top of the better price there was a buy 1 and get a second at half price. Imagine my luck and delight. Every online ad listed the large bag of Blue Senior to be 30lbs. I get the bags home and was looking them over and saw that these bags are only 20lbs. NO WHERE on Blue dog food ads is there a 20lb Blue Senior advertised. Even on Targets ad there is not a 20lb bag of Blue Senior advertised. Talk about low life, sneaky substitution practices. So, if Target will do a switcheroo on something as innocuous as a bag of dog food, BUYER BEWARE.I despise thieves!!"
279,0,"It’s been a while since I last visited a Target store. No great loss. What is it that makes a once quality-managed company like Target go downhill? Poor leadership. Under Brian Cornell’s direction as CEO, Target stores have demonstrated how shabby a customer is treated these days. At East Boynton Beach, Florida, Target team members ignore their phones, managers do not appear on the floor, and Guest Services employees practice rudeness as the preferred way of dealing with customers. And, don’t bother emailing Brian Cornell at the Target address. Those emails don’t get answered. Compare prices at Target, but buy from Amazon, Wayfair, or anyplace else."
746,0,"I made a purchase online on July 6 for my Son. The website stated my two orders would be delivered on August 5,2021. I received a email today on August 18th stating one of my orders was canceled because of delays by Target. I call Target and they tell me I canceled the order and now the item is sold out ! This is a s unacceptable! We have literally been waiting over a month for this purchase and all we received was excuses , lies about why we won’t receive his gifts !!! They just lost a great customer!!!!"
2307,0,I went to a target I had a gift card of $15 I was looking for clothes and shoes but couldn't find my size. Not right to cater to just a particular body size or shape. NEVER going to shop there.
13,0,Target kicked me out because I walked into the worker area where there was no sign they it was not allowed to go there don’t go to target Walmart on top
348,0,"Target's online gift card balance check is a joke!!! The site is designed to redirect you to the login page, so if someone gifts you a card, and you don't want a Target account to receive emails and junk mail and you don't want your contact information on file with them, you can't check your balance. Yes, there is still a phone number, but if I wanted to go through the hassle of calling for the balance, I would have called in the first place instead of going online. I have 7 GCs to check and I don't want to navigate thru menus and have to type that all in on the phone. Rather than making me call, or getting me to create an account, Target's manipulative web practices have just pushed me to shop somewhere else and re-gift my GCs to some other unsuspecting fool! It's honestly the manipulation and useless website that turns me away. Be honest, have some integrity as a company, and try to make it easier for customers to shop with you! Nobody really wants the hassle of checking a GC balance, so don't make it more difficult than it needs to be!!! Lost this shopper!"
691,2,"This is a 50/50 review.  About 6 years ago my wallet with Red debit card in it was stolen.  I went to the store CS desk  to report it and was asked to leave copies of my drivers license and SS card to process a replacement card.  Neither my bank nor credit card company asked for this.  I told the clerk I would show her the ID to prove my identity but I would not allow her to copy or note the info.  I was then refused a replacement card.  I returned to the store another time to try again, same story.  About 2-3 years later I decided maybe I’d have better luck now.  The clerk suggested applying for a new card because maybe the previous account had been closed due to no usage.  Well, again, no luck.  They said my info was already tied to an existing account and refused to replace the card without sending in copies of my ID.  At this point I decided why shop there.  Why would I send in my ID that would be there for any dishonest person to steal?  Fast forward to a few weeks ago.  I became annoyed about not having that damn card that gives me 5% discount.  I decided to apply online for a new account.  Once again, I got a letter that stated my info is tied to an existing account and for help, call.  So I called, skipped my story and just said I was trying to get a replacement of a lost card.  After a short wait, the rep said she had processed the request and I would receive a new card in 7-10 days.  Not in my hands yet, but I’m hopeful.  Target gets a 0 star for their policy.  But I have a 5 star for the agent who processed my request."

1953,0,"Typically I shop at Target because I prefer the store over it's competitor. However, I was sadly disappointed this holiday season when i went shopping in my local store. Aside from the hustle and bustle of customers and crying children, there was total silence in the store. There was no holiday music playing and no one even remotely said ""Merry Christmas"" or even ""Happy Holidays"". And, when i went to shop for a Christmas tree, there were plenty in boxes but few displayed. How do you expect me to decide by looking at the box. What has happened to corporate America? Why are you so eager to recognize everyone else's celebrations but tend to put Christian holidays on the back burner. Do you even realize which country you are in any longer?Hey just to let you know that your competitor actually had Christmas music on as I shopped. And this will be the first time in years that I have shopped at this particular store. I am no longer happy to call your company my favorite store to shop at during any time of the year. Bring back the spirit of the holidays so that others can enjoy it as they shop in your store."

602,0,"Ordered food delivery. Target notified us they did not have an item. Without the item, there was a $35 delivery charge. We weren't given an option to cancel the order or to add to it. They just delivered the order and billed us an additional $35. We called and they said they couldn't do anything. Poor customer service."
326,0,I ordered 3 bottles of Dawn Dish Soap.  When I got it home one of the bottles leaked all over the place because the cap was not screwed on.  They need to teach their shoppers to always always always make sure caps are screwed on tight prior to bagging them.  This could have been disastrous in that it could have damaged my new car upholstery.
2228,0,"I ordered a package of hair color while ago, to be shipped at my door.first of, they did not send it to my location, I called, they said they could not for some reason, and your package was send to federal. I revived lot of call from there to pick up ur package. I did online order since I don't have a car and I explained them that I can not pick up.the agent told me if you don't pick it up in 14 days it's gonna be returned. In the mean while the feddex kept calling to pick it up. Then, after two weeks I got an email that 2 out of 5 hair color was shipped at ur door, which I did not request and I have never received. I called them many times, some one overseas spoke with me each time and said they can not help, and the call has to be transferred, each three time, once they put me on hold the call was disconnected. When I called again they say we won't transfer, so stay on hold. However, the call was disconnected again. Tonite I called again, I was told to call tmrw. It was so frustrating and I will not recommend it."

1538,0,Very good online shopping place
360,0,"I've recently done a lot of holiday shopping on Target's website (among others).  I was thankful and appreciative of the proactive communication when shipping estimates changed.  In an ideal world things would arrived exactly when initially ""promised"", but since we don't live in a world where that is always realistic (especially where we are where weather is unpredictable), Target has set up a great adaptable communication system.  All items in all orders were fulfilled without issue."
1480,0,I went to Target on Hesperian Blvd in Hayward this afternoon and left the store nervous because of so many people. Nobody is keeping their distance and not too many people were wearing masks. They shouldn't allow people to come inside the store without a mask. It is a mandate to wear a mask in public and also to keep your distance of 6 feet apart.
1122,0,"I received an email stating my online order had been picked up even though I didn’t pick it up. I called the store but no one answered the phone. I called the corporate support line and they wanted to just offer a refund. The item was a gift, so the person @ corporate said they would send the issue to a supervisor but it would take 15 minutes to get them on the phone. So while I am waiting, I drive to the store and they say .” We accidentally tendered the order as picked up”.The person at corporate was like ok, glad you got your stuff. They didn’t understand the inconvenience, trouble and anxiety that they caused. This is a multi billion company that can’t correct their mistake or call a customer to let the know their was a mistake.The first person at corporate support didn’t even try to call the store!They believe that this level of service is Ok. They need to hire some IT folks from AMAZON and figure what online and customer service are. All Target did was make their mistake my problem. Another example of Corporate America not getting it."
678,0,If I could give zero stars for their Customer Service I would.  I placed an online order and paid via PayPal (credit card).  The order never made it to me.  I don't blame Target -- there are a lot of shipping issues these days.  However I do blame them for the poor follow-up.  I contacted them to explain the situation and ask for a refund.  They insisted on giving me the refund in the form of a Target gift card instead of refunding my credit card through PayPal.  This is unacceptable and it's a slimy business practice which allows them to keep my money.  They have just lost a customer.
2126,0,"Awesome thing happened today! I ran to target to grab a shirt I saw a few weeks ago that I really liked and would be great for the Luke Bryan concert this week. I got in line for a normal checkout aisle (I refuse to use self checkout, even for 1 item) and the woman in front of me was having trouble with her online coupons for her clothes. The cashier told me it might be a minute and it might be faster to go to another aisle. I assured her it was fine and I was signing up to get the same coupon anyway so I could get the deals also! As I was checking out, I made conversation with the cashier about how I saw the shirt before and I was going to this concert and she thanked me for being so patient. For the wait, she ended up giving me a $5 gift card. I was so thankful! Reasons like this is why I always 1) use regular checkout lanes for actual human interaction. I never would have known about the 20% coupon. 2) just to be genuinely kind to people, and to be patient, it can honestly get you a long way in life.Thank you Mary Ann at the Lien Rd Madison Target for making my day and reminding me why patience and kindness always goes a long way!! She was also very caring and attentive to how her customers days we’re going. She made meaningful conversation with everyone that came through her aisle. After a stressful morning at work in another customer service job, it was refreshing to meet someone like her and I hope I can be as compassionate as Mary Ann"
2236,0,"I recently placed a Target online order, and returned an item to the store.  I used PayPal as the original form of payment, but was given a Target eGiftCard as a refund.  I tried to contact customer service via online chat to see if I could get the refund to PayPal instead.  However, I had issues with the chat window closing abruptly and was not able to resume the chat.  So I then called the customer service number, but the voice prompts were not working.  I then called customer service (using a landline) and got through.  The first agent I spoke with told me several times that they could not refund PayPal, but I persisted and he stated he would try to accomplish that.  He put me on hold for several minutes, then I was disconnected.  I called back and spoke to another agent (Kyle).  Kyle was nice enough to look into what the other agent had started, and he was able to complete the process.  Overall, a relatively simple request took 4 attempts and a lot of time and frustration."

Some of your staff at the 233 Carmichael Way  Chesapeake, VA 23322 location are COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT, RUDE and did nothing to help me. I had left something on hold and drove over an hour to pick it up and they gave it to someone else. You lost my business forever."
2071,0,"Target used to deliver when promised.  THEY NO LONGER DO! I order quite a bit online and almost EVERY “2 day delivery” has taken 4 or 5 days since they ship it regular ground. Shame on you, Target, for completely ignoring your delivery promises.    Geer!"
2628,0,"I purchased two cell phones during the Black Friday sales. Neither one could be activated due to the failure of Target employees to properly scan the phones, so they did not register as purchased. I had to buy replacement phones and plans.

327,0,"I ordered a Christmas gift (the main one) for my son on Dec 17,22. Target said it would arrive prior to Christmas. I recently received an email saying it wouldn't arrive until December 27. I reached out to target and spoke with senior specialist at the corporate office named Christopher. They only thing I was offered was a cancellation of my order. I don't want it cancelled, I wanted the item that was promised prior to Christmas. Target had no answer to why there wasn't posted anywhere, that their could be shipping delays. AND I can't find the item anywhere now. I expressed my concern to Christopher, that if target had said upfront there could be shipping delays, I'd definitely went somewhere else and purchased it in person and not had this entire issue. I don't spend over $500 for one item lightly. It's a big purchase for me. And it means a lot that it won't be under our tree in time for Christmas. Target offered NOTHING. NOT EVEN A $20 GIFT CARD FOR MY TROUBLE. INCREDIBLY SAD FOR A BIG COMPANY LIKE TARGET. I'll never order with target like this ever again. If I can't trust what they promise online, how can anyone else? STAY AWAY FROM TARGET!!"
1416,0,"Target Ross Township Pittsburgh. Ordered several items for pickup a couple days ago. I pulled into a pickup parking space. No information on the sign or the email I received on how to pickup my order. I proceed into the store for items I originally assumed would be brought to my vehicle. I was 5th person in line with one lady working. She had to ring customer orders, do returns and do pickups. Finally a gentleman came to assist her. I generally love to shop at this Target, not today. I could have had these same items delivered to my door for the same price from Amazon. Most stores have a I'm here button in the email. Example Kohl's next door. I spoke with Marina, who was taking care of the self checkouts and expressed my displeasure. She couldn't care less. Not a great experience. Will skip it next time."
787,0,I did the Target drive up. First time. I had to download the app onto my phone to do this. Fortunately I still had some room on my phone. Once I got there I had to answer some questions on the phone like my car make and color and the spot I parked in. I didn't realize that I would have to answer questions like that. At the store you just show your driver's license or some ID. But I suppose it was necessary to make sure the correct person got the correct merch. Then it asked where I wanted the person to put the items. He put them in the trunk and I showed him the code number on my phone and that was that. easy peasy.
884,0,I just love target. Everything right there with the right price!
376,0,I hate having to spend my time looking for coupons and carrying around a bunch of cards to save money. I do not want to carry around a big purse to save at each store. I most of the time don't go to Target because i don't have my card with me.I just received a letter stating my card was going to be canceled because i haven't used it in a while. Why put an expiration date on a card if you can cancel for not using it. Tried to log in and i got a message to set up an account. Tried to set up an account and was not able to get through on that either. In todays world who has time to sit on a computer all night. Called the number on the letter and got one recording after another.Yes your store is clean but you don't have the business that other stores are getting. People are working two jobs to make ends meet. They do not have time to look for coupons or carry a pocket full of credit cards to get a deal.Take my card. I don't like being threatened. My expiration date on my card should be when it ends not end because of my lack of use.

I know my password I have it on my phone so that I don't forget it but every time I put it in they told me it was incorrect or theThe email was after trying it three times I gave up and bought it at Walmart.

1404,0,Worst credit card to have a target card. During covid19 they are still charging fees and don’t take them off... this is shameful on them . Don’t use your target card for anything. Use visa m/c they all are not charging fees like target does .

1915,0,"First, I would like to state that I appreciate the exceptional customer service, my local Target, store always provides. However, I’ve had the unpleasant experience, of dealing with target.com on the phone twice, this week of Christmas.  I ordered a sweater last week, with the “guaranteed“ delivery by Christmas Eve. I checked the status of my two items on Monday, December 23, they were both scheduled to arrive on Christmas Eve. However Christmas Eve morning, one of the items was pushed back to be received, on 26 December. That is absolutely not what target.com “guaranteed”, the week before when I ordered them.  I called target.com, on Christmas Eve, and all they knew how to say is I can refund your items.  That is not the point, my items were supposed to arrive, by Christmas Eve, and I needed it for Christmas day not the day after Christmas.  I was told the item came from a place that wasn’t stocked, which is not my problem.  The second issue was a defective item I ordered on target.com., and Trying to exchange it and it was not sold in stores. The target.com, employee was hard to understand, and her instructions were not clear and kept changing. After I asked her, several times, to explain step-by-step why I couldn’t just exchange it via the phone call and not have to drive to a UPS store and wait for that to get returned and blah blah blah, She was rude and said she had already told me what I needed to know. I then asked to speak to a supervisor or someone else since she wasn’t willing to help me. I was put on hold for 15 minutes and then the call just disconnected. I was furious and contacted my local store, and even though they couldn’t really do anything, they had me in and out, in addition gave me an additional gift card for the store for all of the trouble.She was rude and said she had already told me what I needed to know.

I do not understand how a local target store could be a 90° turn around from the online ordering. It is also crazy that a local target store cannot try to handle or resolve issues easier with target.com purchases since it is the same company.  I hope target will work on some kind of resolution in the near future or figure out something with the target.com customer service issues."

614,0,*PLEASE READ *   On Dec 15th my sons Christmas gift was marked as being delivered at 7:08 am on my door step . Well it wasn’t . I called Target customer service and was told I need to wait 24hrs incase the carrier service mark it by mistake. Well 35 hrs later still no package. I called back Target customer service I was told all they could do was issue request for refund and I would get an email regarding refund. Well here it is Dec 19th still no email about refund or refund in my bank account. Not only am I out of the only Christmas gift my son asked for but out of over $300 cash money since I used my debit card . How is this Acceptable. Is this how Target really hands these types is situations. I’m so frustrated and furious. Thanks Target for Making this an un Merry Christmas 😡

1367,0,I went to Target and I really hate that they have a poor customer service. Based on what I noticed lots of people are complaining about their service and they don't even feel sorry about it. I do recommend that they should be more careful treating their customers and start being professional.

102,0,"I want to thank all of the (real) people out there to have been 'AWAKE' to the 'WOKE'. As observed the wokesters are lining up to fall in line w/the Progressive/Communist sucker bin w/the New Gov mandates that if your company obeys w/out question it will receive the high honors of a complying 'ESG Score' to which fascism will always give favors to, etc. Remember your (pre-woke) pub-school history? The others that did such, went in w/the elite, controlled the press, weaponized institutions, etc. You recall; Mussolini, Hitler, Mao (Xi Jinping),  and the rest of 'the good ole' boys'. This (is) what is occurring 'right now' before (your) eyes so let's let them know we are on to it and let's see how the Targets and Bud-Lites fall as we gently help them down. Boycott is a powerful tool for a democracy. P.S. The 5 star review;""Target is a great Company who embraces diversity and sexual orientation""....  I guess as long as those 'who drank the Cool-Aid' are fighting these kind of odds I am not feeling too threatened with 'group mental illness' (especially after Covid and such). It is also apparent this author does not quite get the protest either which maybe a benefit would be (another) group; 'Therapy'."
2206,0,I went to the West Gate Target to buy some Sonicare replacement tooth brushes.  It turns out that the brushes were locked up and required someone to get them for the customer.  I had to walk quite a long distance to get someone to help.  They had to go to the back of the store to find someone with a key.  All the time I was wasting made me very aggravated.  The item was only thirty dollars.  I question the sanity of locking such a cheap product up.  I question the efficiency of target requiring such a to do in getting the product unlocked.  I almost left.  I am sure most people do leave when confronted with this delay.  Very stupid if you ask me.

1393,0,Even a 1 is too much for this company. Geometric white and black dress. Material so thin it is only really suitable for blouse or underwear. Design is navy not black poorly printed. No details on dress with fabric composition nor how to care or wash the garment. Do not waste your money on this. Never write bad reviews but had to share my thoughts for this company.

626,0,"I have had frustrations with Target gift cards these past 2 years. The first was during their GC promotion last year, so they used that as an excuse due to high volume. This year, I only purchased 2 gift cards without any promotion. One was via mobile, which was supposed to be received within 4 hours. I kept checking the status online and it kept saying it was still preparing. I chatted online with someone who said to come back in 24 hours. I came back the next day and they told me it takes 4 to 24 hours. Well, it was well over 24 hours at that point. The rep told me to call their Gift Card department. There are multiple selections to get you to the correct gift card representative from the GC specific number. They all lead to the same person- a nasty woman that is not in the US and can barely be understood and can hardly speak English! After going through an entire explanation and order/name/address verification, she then says she will transfer you to the correct representative. Wait a minute- I thought she was the correct representative! And to make the issue worse, she pretends to transfer you! You can hear her sitting quietly and waiting for a few minutes. I hung up the first time, called back and it was the same person and the same scenario played out as she pretends to transfer you while sitting quietly on the phone. I had to keep saying, ""hello, are you there?"" All I wanted to do was find out the status of the mobile GC. She kept insisting that she was going to open a ticket and that's all she could do. I didn't want to have a ticket opened, I wanted to just find out when it was going to be sent! The nasty person gave me a huge attitude and said, ""Well it says pending, what do you think pending means?"" Really?? It is impossible finding out any info about gift cards as soon as you place the order! I ordered another gift card through the mail and now I wonder if I will even get that. I tried writing a review on their site, and it will only tabulate the rating and not post my review! I will never purchase a GC from Target again."

In the Order Detail on my account, it said it's non-refundable.  It took a phone call and a nice customer service person to refund me the money charged for the plan.  Which is why I give Target.com 3 stars vs. 1.  Someone in their Marketing Department needs to be fired for conducting business this way.  Are your finances in that much peril Target?"

I was bending down looking at a hand soap, and he came out of no where quickly and approached me (in my personal space as I was bending down to get an item) after he had been following me in the CoverGirl isle. When I went to get a worker, he came up and proceeded to state. ""I was not following her."" Never did he hear what I told the associate that was a maximum 5-10 isles away. Overall, the customer service was amazing however, the security within the store is poor. Thank you associate, Jim, for making me feel safe, aiding in self-checkout, and escorting me to my car. This man deserves a raise!"

I ordered from the Target App on the January 16th, using the Free 2 day shipping, all but one item arrived early on the 17th, Early!!!! That shipment came from Rochester to St. Paul, about 50 miles. My 2nd shipment was supposed to arrive on Saturday the 18th, but didn't arrive until the 20th, coming from Bloomington, 5 miles away.. I was baffled how one shipment that is farther away comes the next day, and the shipment that is very close to Me took 4 days!?!?

I asked if I could buy that one the girl said no they wont be selling the display one til end of December.

Went back a few days later only to see the tree wasn’t there anymore and they had sold it.

I would should be ashamed to say I worked there ! I will never ship there again and neither will my family.
1536,0,"I want to send a great big thanks to the staff of the Target on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington (Rosslyn), Virginia.  During this pandemic crisis, they are providing a HUGE service to the residents of this area.  Despite the risks to their own health by having to come into contact with the public, they are providing friendly service and the hours (including a special 7-8 am shopping time for at risk seniors) are generous.  They do their best to restock items such as eggs, paper towels, etc that are in high demand.  This ""urban"" Target has a good variety of basic items in household, clothing, cosmetics, etc, as well as grocery items including some fresh fruit.  The CVS pharmacy co-located in the facility is open on Saturdays and provides excellent service and advice.  I'm in a long term stay hotel in the area for a several month stay and everything I need, even during the crisis, is pretty much available.  Thank you again, Target, and thank you employees of the Target on Wilson Blvd in Rosslyn for keeping us going at a stressful time like this."
1561,0,"I absolutely LOVE the Target order pickup experience. I've only used it twice now, but it's GREAT! It saves me a lot of time. Even though I can't use it for refrigerator items, I can order many of my dry or non-fridge grocery items, as well as household supplies and housewares.  It's nice being able to browse online, at home, rather than in store (although I do enjoy browsing in store too!) And it's nice being able to find and reserve EXACTLY what I need, because sometimes I can't always find everything I need on the shelves in store.Both times I've used this service, I've come in to do some shopping first, getting the things I couldn't order online (fridge items, etc), and then I've finished with the pickup. There's never been a long wait. Even if there are 1 or 2 people in line, it still saves me the time and effort of walking all around the entire store to find everything myself!  It also enables me to check the online store, to see if something I need is in stock, which saves me the trouble of going to the store just to find out.It's wonderful that it's a free service. I will be using it more and more in future. Thank you Target, for providing this service!"

452,0,"I thought that after facing a very bad experience with online order, an awful solution offered by the phone “which was making a new order, paying again, and only receiving the refund for the damaged order when the products are received by Target. Which means pay twice. After hearing that option by the CS over the phone I went to the store, there o returned the products, got refunded for it, and was informed by team members inside the store, when I inquired with the products were carried in store, I was told that unfortunately not, no Target store would carry the products only online, and that they would probably come damaged again, because of the heat during summer. Also it is not Target responsibility to pack the products properly to arrive in good condition is UPS responsibility. Besides all that, Target only apologized for and said two of the products are in a certain store, if I want to buy it. Nothing else, absolutely nothing.I was super excited about getting these products to share with my daughter, and it didn’t happen. Besides disappointed, sad and frustrated, I felt like a ping pong ball, just being toying around, without being properly addressed. Some of my friends told me, so not worry, Target takes good care of their clients. Maybe with you are White American and don’t have an accent. Otherwise, it’s just I am sore for the inconvenience.I will not recommend shopping Target online. The website is not accurate, because it doesn’t show if the products are available for pick up, and doesn’t refresh with the zip code you place. Very, very, sad."

If it was not for the customer service in the stores I would have closed my card and never shop there again.
809,0,"I was in the store in Owings Mills, MD on last morning. I had just had death in my family. I asked the young lady to double bag me and make my bags light because I am walking. She caught an attitude and said that she did not hear me. I said okay and I walked away. I had to do it myself. In the mean time two other employees gave their opinion because they all believed I was gone. Another customer came over and put his mouth in my business as well. I spoke up and out. I told him to mind his business and I apologized to the young lady if she did not hear me. I explained that I was dealing with something right now that had nothing to do with her or the other customer that was being judgmental. What is sad to me is that as a senior citizen we are always disrespected and being treated very rudely. I have to fight all my life for everything. I will continue to shop and fight for what is right and the wrong things folks are doing to paying customers can go straight to the pit of hell with the devil and all his imps. We have to stand up for what is righteous and not be afraid to speak up for our rights. Shalom and blessings..."
2506,0,"CHECKS NOT WELCOME I've shopped at Target for years.  I always pay with check.  I did not know that if you buy more than 100 dollars you can not pay with check unless you have built up a ""history"" .  I was humiliated in line while my check was rejected.  I had to get cash from the crappy ATM to pay.  I find this policy completely insane.  Obviously my check is not welcome and there is no posted policy about NO CHECKS.   So I'll be spending my money via my checking account at Walmart, Meijers,  and Kroger --all stores with far superior customer service!"

Not even a THANKYOU. Tried to contact Target. Called 8x. Rings and rings…. even tried HR. Nothing. Rings and rings. What’s going on with Target in Novato, CA??????"

2223,0,"Thanks to Amazon, Target is beginning to ""circle the drain.""An employee at a Target store told me that the $15 per hour thing is just a public relations move to improve their image. What Target didn't tell the media is that they are cutting out a number of employee positions to force more work on to fewer people. They are also cutting non-management worker's hours by around 50%, so they will not be eligible for ANY benefits whatsoever. So basically they are actually getting paid LESS than before.Another bad thing about Target is their phone app. It uses your GPS to raise the prices on their website to match the prices at the Target store that you are in, so you pay a higher price by not being able to price match.The last complaint is that their weird bathroom policy, that allows either sex to use either bathroom, is still in effect.Do yourself a favor, and stay away from Target."
1261,0,Kudos to mangers Ashley and Hailey at the Fairlawn store for awesome customer service!! There was an error in purchasing a Nintendo game. The electronic guy needs to be retrained but I will stick to the positive experience. These ladies spent so much tIme making calls and attempting procedures with the register. Thank you so much! I had plans and I was frustrated but the kind mangers were so kind and set me at ease with their attempts to correct the problem. You made Target look good tonight! Thank you again and I appreciate you both.❤❤
1237,0,My best advice-if you speak a second language other than English use it!  They have a translator service.Rude american and philipines call centers.  They use translator service.  Philipines will not allow supervisor.  I sung to the rep for 5 minutes.
21,0,Please do not buy anything from this company. As they do not help when you are trying to get a refund. They keep saying someone will get back to you in next 24 hours and 7 days go by without nothing being resolved. It's almost a non refundable site no matter how much you spend. Please don't fall into this trap like I have and lost £246
1136,0,I tried to order two items on my daughters Christmas list and one item was shipped to the wrong address and instead of making sure the other item was sent to the correct address my order was cancelled and they say i have to wait 30 days to get the rest of my money back. My account is pending. It wasn't my fault and it is unfair.  Now i have ro wait to reorder because im on a budget.
2260,0,I read the many negative reviews and I  have decided to write of my recent experience with customer service.  I called Target.com many times for information regarding a purchase that was under warranty but no longer within the 90 day return agreement. This product did not offer the extended warranty. I also received the run around like the other review mentioned .  I found customer service was simply unable to provide accurate information regarding the purchase or how to contact the manufacturer. It was annoying that it took 3 phone calls for them to just say That!

2063,0,"I will not order with Target ship to store again. I had such a horrible experience. My order was delayed multiple times. It took weeks. Finally the order arrived at the store where I was supposed to pick it up, but they would not allow me to. They said it would take 7 business days for them to process it. After all of that, they cancelled my order citing ""Technical Issues on their end blahblahblah"". How can you have technical issues if the order made it to the store and was in processing? However, you still charged my card. I better see my refund on my card or else Im calling my bank to reverse these charges and reporting to the BBB on how bad this company really is.  Target get yourselves together!! We can all easily drop you and order from Amazon."

Congratulations! You’ve changed your whole culture. I’ll never return, what a shame! Join the boneyard with bud light."
576,0,"Don’t buy on Target website. They have some anti-consumer policies. When setting up your payment method for an order, they automatically put a authorization hold on the total amount. Even if you can’t finish the order, the hold remains.Have talked to three reps and a supervisor. No help. One said it’d be resolved in 5 hours but it hasn’t. PayPal claims 24 hours but Target website says it can extend the hold indefinitely.Regardless, Target will hold your money before the order is ever placed. If the order is canceled or flawed, the money remains frozen. Don’t shop at Target."
405,0,Usually things like dish liquid & anything liquid are placed in a smaller box together with reinforced tape on them and are also enclosed in a rather thick plastic bag. No spills Even spray cans & stuff are secured with tape & a bag. This time they just threw everything in a big weak box no tape no bags and dish liquid + drain cleaner leaked all over everything. It also looks like UPS tried to tape the box up on the side. It was delivered to me with a wet spot so I knew right away it was messed up. I had to clean other items in the box off & let them dry. Thank God their drain cleaner is not strong because Target brand Draino had leaked too. All the Target order packer had to do was secure those 2 items. I know it's super busy but Lord. Also 2 items missing.

Hey how about this idea Target, hire some US based support cause the people you have working for you when you call customer service are just awful!!!  I will no longer be shopping with you after today and will be bringing my business elsewhere. I’m calling to cancel my red card as well."
91,0,I have been a Target shopper for many years and even worked as a cashier as a teen. I'm now 70 and I have shopped at Target for the last time. I'm so tired of business's having a political agenda. The latest LBG whatever thing is it for me. If you're a girl you don't need a pouch in your swimming suit. Just because I'm not rioting I can show you I'm done by never giving Target another cent of my money. You maybe should of learned something from Budweiser.
467,0,"There's no catalog for all products, too much time clicking and looking for something. it sucks. Developer is not working at all. I have seen bugs in the site, specially in loading items/products in categories. it limited the items display up to 1200 items .. srly?. 50 pages and 24 items per page."
212,0,This company is not ran well at all. I think Target is trying to be the next Bud Light. The store in North Spokane was full of transgenders and phage. I’m disgusted and look forward to your bankruptcy Target. Transgender children’s clothing????? You outta be ashamed of yourself. I will never support a company that feels like they need to shove this phag crap down our throats. I’m finished with two companies now.
1499,0,"Horrible customer service. Target sent me an email notifying me that two items I had in my shopping cart were on sale. I went online and try to purchase those items for the reduced sale price, but was unable. Tried multiple times, multiple different ways, but was unable to get the reduced sale price. So, I called customer service and explained that I received an email stating that items in my shopping cart had gone on sale, but I was unable to purchase them online at the sale price. They look into it and told me the sale was over, even though I just received the email. They were very unhelpful and unresponsive and would not award the sale price despite sending it to me in an email with an expiration date within the time frame that I received it. Their explanation was that my email must have come in late or I didn't open it on time, but the dates are all there. Very unhelpful spent over an hour on the phone between being on hold and being transferred between representative. I will not be shopping at Target and I don't recommend anyone do it either. They were very very unhelpful and unconcerned with my issues"

2434,0,"I applied for a Redcard (Target credit card) in order to finish my Christmas Shopping up. I have looked everywhere for the one thing I needed to finish up. Found it on Target.com.. applied for the card, got approved, followed all the steps they gave me to use my new account to pay for the things in my ""cart"".. Got all the way down to the payment portion of the check out and they say I needed the full credit card number.. EVEN though I followed all the steps to save all that info into my account Wallet... I called the customer service and was transferred 3 different times and had been on the phone a total of 50 mins between talking and being put on hold... by the third person I was feed up and asked to talk to a supervisor.. They put her on and that woman kept me on hold for almost 2 HOURS!!!!!! To just get back on the line to tell me she couldn't help me! 2 HOURS!!!!! My husband thought I was crazy for waiting but I honestly thought she had found a solution and was taking care of it. I will NEVER purchase another thing at Target! I'm a Walmart girl anyhow, and after this I will always be! Target.com /Customer service SUCKS, and should be ashamed of the way they treat paying customers!"

Part of my order had 3 Enoz Lavender Scented Moth Bars:  Target shipped ONE broken bar out of 3 -I took a photo-. Then I found out ""the product can only be returned to a Target store""???I shop online because I CANNOT get to a store.Target ignores emails and Facebook posts. It looks like Target is shipping items that can't be sold in stores. I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB."
689,0,"Target has a history of selling exclusive items, the main problem is that they issue their exclusives to be purchased only by scalpers. The vast majority of costumers can't get their hands on so called ""exclusives"" because those items are never available at a decent time, neither Target limit the amount of items that 1 person can buy. Last exclusive they had was available for purchase at 2am! And only lasted for sale for less than 30 min because all the scalpers had their hands on them! It is really ridiculous that Target have those selling practices! There are many angry costumers because they never have anything new to buy at, either, their website or actual stores! They seem to sell leftovers or items nobody wants at their stores. I will not waste my time going back to Target."
2048,0,"Target has nice clean stores but spending $100,000 to promote the gay lifestyle for children is abominable. Those who do such things will be held to account and for a company to do this, is awful. I have posted on Facebook so everyone who reads it will know what Target is doing."

2580,0,"I tried their Restock service after surgery for convenience sake.  The items I needed they canceled and delayed shipment of my order. I had added items to fill the box that I didn’t really want. They would not let me cancel the order or offer a substitution. All I really wanted was a convenient way to buy toilet paper post surgery. They told me I would have to go to the store to return my unwanted items, which negates the purpose of using Restock."
56,0,"We would shop at Target as they had a decent pricing and selection for young children. Then I found out the negativity from the ownership toward the US military and now with a Satanist spokesperson/ lead clothing line design. Nope, we are gone! And will not return. Hope they close them all."

Total waste of time and gas and Target gives no compensation at all. Amazon and Walmart will at least compensate you with a small giftcard when they mess up. Target gives the old ""Sorry. That would frustrate me too."" spiel and that is all. At this point I've totally given up on Target as a reputable company."
2616,0,I agree bait and switch.   Not what I paid for.  I think they are a scam
1203,0,I love Target. It is a nice clean store with nice shopping carts. Friendly great customer service. Find hard to get items like Chlorax wipes and wet ones. Thank you.
1217,0,rarely go to this target because I generally have a negative experience but today we had to get some things and this target was on our way to our destination. the target was sold out of everything we needed but me and my girlfriends collect funko pop figures from time to time and noticed they had a mad hatter and a couple 10' mewtwos. we got in line which took about 45 mins due to how long the lines were but that isnt an issue because it was a Saturday. when we got up to the front of the line the funko pops had an issue scanning so a manager came up. apparently they don't go on sale till tomorrow so the manager took the product from us and told us there is nothing he can do or help us with so he just walked off. i tried asking if he could hold it or sell it to us early and he just ignored me and walked away without even trying to be nice in anyway. if you like being treated like an actual customer i highly recommend going to a different target. everytime i go to this location they never have what i need and always treat me like a burden in the store.

881,0,"With all due respect, I never write reviews for a company. However, my story needs to be told. I placed an order on line a hour later I got an email indicating that they didn't have the item. Then, a hour later I got an email stating that it was being shipped to my billing address in Brooklyn NY but I live in New Jersey. Then, I got another email stating that the order was cancel. I made several attempts to cancel the order via online & over the telephone at the Princeton Target. When I spoke to the customer service representative & the manager, they said my order was canceled. After speaking with them on 4/8, I received an email on 4/9 stating that my order was shipped to brooklyn meanwhile I live in NJ. I haven't been to New York in a year because of Covid-19. When I called today to speak to the manager (4/9), her attitude was nonchalant. To make a long story short I called Target in Princeton & the head office in Arizona to cancel the order and it was still shipped to the wrong address. I made several attempts to stop the order from going to the wrong address. I'm done I will NEVER order online with Target, again because they don't care."

There were Target employees all over place primary talking to themsleves and avoiding eye contact with guest in an effort to hope the guest would ask them a guestion   There two HUGE lines for only registers open.  Never seen anything like it.  Target more more like Walmart except walmart has reversed cours added back more customer service lanes.  I left cart with app $400 in in walked out store.  Target does value me a customer.  Another reason to back home and ordere what i need from Amazaon and Whole Foods.    I would n't trust using this pharmacy.   It so short staffed no do doubt there medical mistakens being made. One pharamacist and on pham tech to deal with insurance calls, doctors office, new paitent, filling the scripts, giving shots the list goes on.  Normall free stand CVS has two pharmacist + 3 to 4 tech.  They are crushing it with good customer service.  I changed my pharmacy to free standing CVS along time ago.  You are looking lot of sale from phramcy customers have transferred business to poot stafffing/service of the pharmacy.  Pharmacy staff are awesome they set up to fail from the world go.  YOu thought member for the board or investor would notice just on their own walk through of store how bad an idea is was to sale to CVS.  Look at same sales 12 an 18 month trailing cycles for the same people you see drop off like a cliff"

At the time of purchase, the cashier put the receipt in the bag and wished me a good day. As it turned out my grandson wanted something else so I returned to Target to return, about $50.I was told that this item was “Not Returnable “??? After a 20minute discussion with 2 managers they finally agreed on the return. No one told me that is not returnable!Beware, look at your Receipts,"

2623,0,"I had ordered the overcast color of a TV Stand from Target online before Christmas with guaranteed delivery before C/Day. For some reason, the system generated a wrong color and I received it in a different color (navy blue). That was supposed to be our part of nursery collection for a scheduled Christmas baby and was disappointed to find a color we did not want. So I called Target customer support, who offered me a discount for the replacement order. I accepted that offer, however, I was asked to pay separately for the replacement and Target could not issue me even store credit for the return right away to get my replacement. Since it was a heavy piece of furniture, I opted for a home pick up of the product for return. Target customer support gave me a confirmation for pick up by UPS. I waited for one week for a courier to show up for pick up and no one did. I called UPS about the issue but they stated that they don't have any information. At that point, I felt frustrated enough with Target's process and somehow managed to haul it away to the UPS store.  They told me that i would have to call Target again to get a return shipment label as they couldn't take it without one. Waited again in the wait line to get through to Target. I eventually dropped off the returning product with shipment tracking at UPS Store on Dec 27th.  The tracking no. shows that it was delivered to Target's identified warehouse destination on Dec 29th. However, I have still not received my refund because Target's policy requires an additional 7 to 10 business days after receipt - could it be any more non-customer oriented process I wonder by any other retailer!?  I have spoken on multiple occasions with customer support and their line supervisors with request for resolving this issue and the endless time it has taken but apparently no one could help by any work-around. IF that's the way Target does business online where returning an online purchase to a store cannot issue refund/ credit for online orders either, I am never shopping online with target again. To me, this business process belongs to last century not the current one. I did not expect that from a large retailer giant like target. Hey Target, if you think like K-Mart, expect no different future! Very disappointed!"

2121,0,"I have been ordering from Target.com for awhile and have never had a problem with the order or shipping until....the last order. I ordered liquid laundry detergent and several other items. In the past all liquid items or any item with a potential to leak were tightly wrapped in a plastic baggie.  This time they weren't and one of the detergent jugs leaked on the other items. I took quite a few pictures, thinking I would need them for proof of damage. On the webpage there is a spot for problem with order...I clicked on it, marked what products were damaged gave a brief description....no pictures needed....they were sending new items right away.  No hassle!! So very impressed!And I did not need to return the damaged items."
1981,0,Purchased several items and wanting to save time I chose pick up. Unfortunately the pick up is the same line as returns. There were several people in line which seemed to take extra long. Very disappointed there wasn't a seperate line for pick up only. I think we were in the store longer than if we had gotten the items ourselves and used self check out. We will never use pick up again under these circumstances.
2026,0,"I usually love Target, but the pick up in store service is a joke! I recently purchased an item on line to pick up in store, and specified the store I wanted to pick it up in. It was showing as available in that store. The next day I went to pick it up, and the item was not at that store, but at a different store in the area. When I went to the second store, they couldn’t find my item.,after waiting 15 minutes, I finally asked for a refund. I was given what I was made to understand a refund on my credit card. And also a $10 gift card for my inconvenience. I ended up placing the order in line and used my $10 gift card.  I checked my bank statement several days later, and I did not receive a credit on my credit card. I received an e gift card as a refund. I called customer service to get my card credited, and they credited my on line purchase, not the one I did in store. So I still did not receive the full credit on my charge. Just saying that I will never use the buy online, pick up in store option again!"

The rep told me to call back if my bank has no record of the credit. I will NEVER order from target.com again. Worst customer service ever!"
2533,0,Employees at Augusta location ignore customers and are rude. It is also impossible to find what you’re looking for at this location. Another thing is that the website cannot be trusted to tell you whether an item is in stock or not.

Same this time where the mini bikes were already bad and the bread moldy(still within date on bag)Becoming more of a hassle but to have 2 products in one order bad/spoiled is just ok. These items shouldn’t be in the store. I will say when I go to pick up my order they’re great!Do better target!Date below is approx date of order

A housekeeper a Lady who looked latin and maybe drunk for your behavior, who was cleaning the floor was very rude, and yelled at me, MOVE.  and spoke in Spanish muttering  other words, also she was not careful when she saw what i was going through to go up the stairs and i don't know if CARELESSLY or NOT she threw garbage at me that she was sweeping.I try to inquire the company what she works for but unfortunately i didn't get any information so i had to complain in this review .

I had been looking all over town for this particular movie and was so glad that the store had it. When I got home to look at the movie the movie did not work. I called the store and the associate told me to bring the movie back for exchange. I went back to the store to return the movie. When I got home I had the same problem with the movie again this movie also did not have the digital copy inside. I was a little frustrated so I decided to call the store manager. I spoke to Target Manager Daniel and explained the problems I was having with the product. Daniel was very polite and insisted upon making my shopping experience better. He told me he would go look for the movie in the store and test it himself to see if it worked. He said he will call me back once he tested the movie. Daniel called me back to confirm the movie worked. Daniel also said he would leave the movie at the Guest  Services counter so it would be there when I arrived. I had already made two trips to the store and wasn’t really in the mood to make a third but I really wanted the movie so I decided to go get it. When I arrived the movie was at the guest counter and Daniel came out and greeted me and apologized that I was having problems with the movie. During this time there was a lady at the counter she was asking if someone could call her a Lyft or Uber so that she could get home to Los Angeles. Daniel took the time to help her by letting her know he would make the call for her. Daniel went above and beyond to rectify the situation he took the time-himself to find me the same movie, test the movie to see if it worked, called me to verify this before I came back to the store and had the movie waiting for me at the guest service counter when I arrived. To top things off he took the time to come out to the guest counter to greet me and he helped this lady. I left the store feeling better about the purchase. I just want to thank him and the guest services associate that was on that afternoon and evening for the awesome customer service. I feel it was a great effort to promote service recovery and high quality customer service. I was really impressed with the way Daniel helped that lady. it’s really nice to see someone showing compassion to someone less fortunate especially during this time we are in due to the pandemic.Daniel took the time to make sure I was satisfied and not dissatisfied.I am 62 years old and and It’s hard for me to get around. I shop at this Target store quite frequently. I just want to say thank you for all that you do, your dedication to service and for helping me with my shopping concernSincerely,  Melinda"

When I called the customer service, they said they could not verify my address and could not send me the card. My address is valid and multiple major online retailers and major finanacial institutes were able to send me packages or mails. They told me there is nothing they can do about it, and will not be able to honor their promotional coupon.Consumers should be aware that Target will scam you to sign up for the RedCard but will not honor their promotional coupon.Not listening to customers is why Target failed big time in Canada."
2588,0,"Going back to amazon.  Seriously what is with the online ordering?  I ordered 4 boxes of swiffer dusters and they came in TWO shipments, the boxes were way larger than necessary, the swiffer boxes were smashed and the shipping boxes were busted and open.  (probably not a huge deal but come on now).  So i ended up returning the entire thing to the store and getting a refund.I tried again and ordered a total of 5 different items- its shipping in FOUR different boxes via 2 carriers - talk about a waste of resources, time and energy.  This is going to be delivered on 2 different days- outside the '2 day free shipping' window so again, why bother.  What do you want to bet at least one of the boxes is inappropriately packed, arrives busted and I have to return to the store.This never ever happens with amazon."
2448,0,Ordered something with 2 day shipping has been a week called in today they told me  Their computer tells them they still have 4 days I told him I have a screenshot with a print out of my today delivery....they don't care.. I will Make sure I always order Amazon they never failed me!!!!
2523,0,I live in Canada. I placed an order on target.com. There were about seven items. And I got seven shipments in the span of three weeks. It was so hard to keep up. Also they left over sized boxes at my door early in the morning obviously when I got home at night they weren’t there anymore. Trying to get through to anybody there is impossible. I refuse the last two shipments as it’s absolutely ridiculous to send that many parcels. Consolidate it and then send it. And do not leave $300 items at the door. Apparently there’s an ongoing investigation. I don’t understand why I did not sign for a package that was left at the door. It’s not my fault that the courier company cannot do their job properly. Next time use FedEx. I have already contacted my credit card company to advise them so they can reverse the payment.
1977,0,They never send anything on time and their customer service is a joke. They are of no help and when you finally can get help they lie about trying to fix it. Ordered an item they was weeks late so they issued a refund and promised to send it out for free. That was again late and when I called about it they said it was still being processed. When I asked for a different size since the size was wrong and they still haven't finished processing they went and cancelled the order and hung up on me. When I called back to try and fix it or get the order restored and they hung up again. When I called again and asked for a supervisor the 3rd time the were willing to reorder and only offer a 10% discount.

I had to call back three times to finally reach a sensible person with no hearing issues. I will never shop at target.com again."

However, it is now December 8, and I still have not received a refund. I have called the customer service line, several times to no avail. First they were saying, ""Oh shipt has your money.""

240,0,Would go with 0 stars if possible. I wanted to replace or get a refund of a product that was *months* within the warranty. I was given a complete runaround by NINE separate Target representatives who all refused to either make it right or escalate me to someone who could. Avoid buying from Target at ALL costs. If you need a product go find it elsewhere.

269,0,"Target needs to get their act together. We shop online and do store pick-ups on a regular basis where their employees bring out merchandise to your car. At least 20% of the time, Target bills us in full but we end up with missing items when we unload the car and bring everything in the house. The other night we were missing (2) packs of ground meat. Although Target did refund us, I don’t understand why this keeps happening.Christmas of 2022 my wife ordered all groceries. When she got home, instead of groceries she received 15 items of all women’s & baby clothing. She took everything back to the store and received a $5 Target gift card for the inconvenience.I wonder ???? When the store closes at night, does Target think that all the left over carts and totes full of purchased merchandise is a gift from God ?? Is it a miracle from heaven?Lastly, my daughter picked up items for taco’s. We pre-ordered online and the employee brought out the most disgusting bag of old lettuce.We did not find out about it until after my daughter got home. The bag expired (3) days prior to purchase."

782,0,HORRIBLE ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Transferred 5 times disconnected once. Could not understand accents from different countries. Extra frustrating after order was damaged and they a sent chair with the wrong fabric (team member ordered wrong fabric for me in store). They made me purchase a new chair before they would credit my account when it was their mistake.  They are trained to talk WAY TOO MUCH on the calls. Simple yes or no answers instead they go on and on and on and on.  Socializing and laughing in background of caller from outside USA.  Would not be acceptable customer service in USA. I will not be ordering furniture online ever again from Target. Really bummed.
1847,0,"So I love target I go shopping there all the time,but lately I've been shopping online which I really dont like to do because I prefer to shop on my own. But everytime I walk in the store like the Gilroy AND Morgan hill California targets they seem to automatically judge me biased off my appearance if you dont look white enough or look like you have money your autmaclly labeled as someone who's stealing, I use to work in retail for 3 years as loss prevention so I know how all the procedures go and I know what staff has to do when they think someone is stealing so I know I'm not over reacting when I say target makes you feel like your doing something wrong when your not ! Staff constantly follows me around the store watching me and treating me like I'm a criminal or something and I've never stolen a thing in my life I pay for everything I buy and I work very hard for my money so I'm completely offended when target profiles people. Its extremely uncomfortable to shop and have people following you and watching you then have security waiting at the end of check out line I'm telling you the look on there faces when I pay for my stuff is price less but still it is not okay to make innocent people feel like there being profiled because they dont look rich or white enough for you I may look intimidating but that does not give target employees to treat other people differently. While your too busy watching me the real people who are stealing just got away with it ! . Do better target that is not okay how you make people feel and how you stalk your costumers around the store."
1327,0,"Because I am limited on time I recently purchased items online off of a wedding registry and paid the extra $5.99 per item to have ""gift wrapped"". There were 3 items total. The ease of ordering I rate a 1. Receiving the items in a timely manner, I give a 10 but I paid $5.99 x 3 a total of $17.97 for target to ""wrap"" the gifts I purchased and i am so disappointed. First of all, 2 of the 3 items are in a red gift bag, ok that's fine I can deal with that, but the bag looks as if a 5yr old threw it together. There is ribbon around it, about 10 ft too much and a sad attempt for a bow. Secondly one of the items isn't even wrapped, It's in bubble wrap only with my little gift card receipt taped to it. I could be somewhat ok with that if it was then placed In some sort of GIFT WRAP or gift bag but it's just in bubble wrap. Now I have to go to store, buy actual gift wrapping paper and wrap myself which I don't have time for before my event (hence paying the extra fee) way to disappoint target. Very upsetting."

2137,0,"The local store closes to my house, needs to train their customer service employees better. Their Caucasian employees need to stop profiling people who are not white, just because it’s a “white and rich” neighborhood. I’ve lived down the street from the store longer than it was built there but just because I’m a POC, doesn’t mean I should be treated as a robber when I’m there at least once a week and multiple employees (in other sections of the store) know me. Plus, if you want to talk about me behind my back as an employee, either tell me to my face or go in the break room. Such dumb Caucasian employees who think they are above POC customers, when we live in a large immigrant city."

I was told it is, so I asked to close it again  Transferred again I said closing cause the people there are not professional and lie give different stories so no trust  He said I could open again in 90 days.

733,0,Just a bad experience every time I try to shop. I am a professional shopper who can't do my job when I am sent there. They Have 1 store in Wilmington NC to service a huge population. The store is always so empty it looks like it is going out of business. I went there to get 10 items. The first 3 on the list were out of stock. I actually had to cancel the order. We need another store in this area. They have such an opportunity to take over the old Kmart store I don't understand why they are not trying to grow. Covid changed the way people shop and Target is living in the past.

1252,0,"Ordered canned goods online to minimize handling.  Complete waste of time.  One would think cans would be stacked on cases they originally come in, one would be wrong.  No, they just throw everything randomly into a box that is way too big.  All the boxes were crushed, about 30-40% of the cans were damaged. And now I have to individually handle each can, stack, and find cardboard boxes that the cans will fit in, defeating the whole purpose of ordering bulk online.Not to mention the items were supposed to arrive on one day.  Nope, about 12 different deliveries over a 5 day period.  Ill never shop at Target again."

I get free 2 day shipping, which I needed b/c I wanted the item in 4 days and without the red card that shipping would have cost $21. Dress cost $17. Spent an hour signing up and ordering only to be told it's impossible to order a item inside the store at any Target AND because I didn't have my actual card and I do not know my card number I can't purchase this item. Called cust. serv. went through the whole process  with them they said they have my number and all the info. - I said great please give me my number to order the item and they said ""sorry we are not allowed to give card numbers over the phone!"" And they still didn't offer to order the dress right then and take care of the problem!! They said I could order online when I got my card in 7 - 10 days!??

We’ve called Fed Ex 2 dozen times, they lie on the phone to you, had many times where the package showed up 3-5 days later because of so-called exceptions or needing a signature which the shipment never needed a signature to begin with and said the homeowner was not at home, when I was here video evidence shows that they never even stopped at our residence!!"

857,2,"I ordered two Wicker Patio Rocking Chair on target.com. #1067975519685. FedEx delivered the order on 4/25/21 around noon. My husband assembled the chair; it took him over an hour. When he opened the second box,  one of the woven seat straps is broken. He re-box the broken chair. I went online chat with the customer service rep. I told her the situation and asked for a replacement for the broken chair. she said the chair is out of stock, so I asked for a return and refund. she said I can’t return just one because they were sold as a set. I said they are two individual chairs and sold individually. She said, but the one I bought was sold in two as a set. I said so you want me to unassembled a good chair that we spent over an hour putting together and box it to return because the other is bad? You ended up to sale the good one by itself anyways. She said that is the policy. I asked for a manager. She transferred me to her “senior specialist”. The woman repeated what the other sales rep said, and I repeated what I said before she asked me to take a picture of the broken chair to provide me a discount. I told her why I would want a discount on a broken chair. She said, I am trying to help to resolve the issue. I said you asked me to reopen the box to take a picture to send to you so you can decide if you want to give me a discount, which I do not want a discount on a broken chair. She said, “I wanted to help you, but you are not cooperating so I have to end the chat,” I said you are not listening, I don’t care how much discount you will give to me, I don’t want to keep a broken chair” she ended the chat.  I called the phone number listed at the end of the chat. I was holding for a manger; and I was disconnected; then I called back. The woman said since you already talk to a specialist, so there is no one else you can talk to. I called the Target store near me. I asked for the manager, her name is Andi. I repeated the situation to her, she asked for the item number. She looked up and said, “I don’t understand why online refuse you to just return one because these chairs are sold individually as well”, she said; since the order is online, she can’t order a replacement for me but she would accept a return for one chair. There! That is customer service and competence. Target- you need to hire more people, provide really customer services NOT those people copy the chat script “we are here to help..” “I am sorry for the inconvenience...” then the real answer is “ sorry I can’t help.. it’s the policy..” the “senior specialist” has no common sense whatsoever. She should be fired for how she treats the “you are our value customer” seriously?!  It took just a minute for the store manager to find out the chairs are sold individually, even though the one I ordered was sold two as a set. I should've known better to stick with either Amazon or Walmart.com"

Of course none were on the shelf when I arrived, associate checked and agreed there were none at this store and this does happen.  Last month the same experience with a different item; website stated there was inventory available at this store and none was on the shelf.  I actually checked it on my phone standing in front of the empty shelf; website said one thing, actual store inventory was none.  A few weeks ago I purchased a mixing bowl set at Target and the price on their website was lower than the actual price in the store.Store was the Boulevard Mall, Amherst, NY for all these issues.I can understand why brick and mortar stores are closing, can't even resolve inventory agreement between stores and website.I'm done with Target."

2438,0,"DO NOT SHOP ONLINE AT TARGET! Especially during the holiday or for holiday gifts! This is not only the first nor the second time but the THIRD time this has happened! I waited up until 2am for the sale to go up online and was able to get the product I wanted, ordered and paid for and everything. Only to first have my ordered delayed than completely canceled a few weeks later! I vow to never order from them again even if I have to spend a few more dollars somewhere else. Even Walmart has better service and actually guarantees that you will receive the product you ordered."
2169,0,"I have been a devoted Target customer for years. When I was at the checker a few weeks ago in Cathedral City, CA, I was asked if I'd like a Target card; I could save 5% immediately. I said yes, but was then told - in front of a line of people - that my application was denied. I later received a letter of explanation from Target.Target said my credit score was too low: The report they quoted said 816, which is nearly perfect. They said my income was too low. I have my tax returns showing I made $76,000 last year. I currently have over $100,000 in my checking account, and savings from pensions and  stock portfolios. I have no debts. I own my home and my car. Being single I have no dependents.Well, if Target thinks I'm a bad risk, I don't want them anymore! I will do my business elsewhere."
2183,0,I just wanted to let you know that I am very disappointed in Target Online Ordering. I added $90 worth of girls clothing for my granddaughters to my Target shopping cart. I needed to have them shipped to a military base in Okinawa Japan. I went through all the ordering steps but when I came to the shipping page to add the shipping address it would not take it. It kept giving me errors. I formatted the FPO and AP exactly how it was stated on your website but it still gave errors.I immediately contacted customer service through your chat feature and they told me to contact the second level customer service department and they gave me the number. I called them and once again explained my address input issues. They asked me for the address and I provided it to him. He tried several times to input the address in the system but again it wouldn't take it. He told me that there was nothing more he could do.It clearly states on your website that you do ship to FPO AP addresses. I realize some items are restricted for those shipping addresses but I checked every item I added to cart for any restrictions and there was none.One of the main reasons I chose to order from Target was because free shipping is offered. Now I have to have everything shipped to my home address and ship it myself. This is unacceptable considering you advertise that you ship to military bases.I would have cancelled my order if it had not been for the fact that the girls already picked out specific items in the cart. But rest assured I will not be shopping online at Target ever again and probably won't shop at the stores either.
1307,0,"Absolutely terrible customer service. Applied for red credit card, received application denial letter in the mail. for not validating checking account information.Called customer service to clarify. Was told that I did not pick method of verification while applying. I explained that that is not possible since the application required the choice of answer and would not let to continue with application.The rep recommended to apply again and call back with any issue if it happens again. I asked her to be on the phone with me for like 1 minute to try again so she can check on her end if it goes through. When I ask if she can stay with me for one minute she said NO! and hanged up."

Well read above, do yourself a favor and take yourself else, at least for online orders and preorders if you actually want to receive them"
1933,0,Target ruined Christmas!!! They refunded my online order which I placed on 12/2 and when I called customer service yesterday I was hung up on. Never given a good reason as to why it was refunded. They just tell you an email was sent that they knowingly goes to your spam. I had to call back 3 times and they gave me a $15 gift card yet didn’t fix my issue. I had to order gifts on amazon and thank God my child will still receive some gifts by tomorrow. When I called today to speak to a manager she said they SHOULDN’T have given me a $15 gift card for my inconvenience. Needless to say I canceled my red card and I’ll never shop at target again. It is sad because that was my daughters favorite store. It is shocking and disappointing that they didn’t even attempt to fix it and didn’t seem to care that a 4 year old child wouldn’t have toys on Christmas.
697,0,"Target is very wonderful.  They ship very fast, and the prices are lower than in other companies. And one totally wonderful thing happened today.UPS lied and said what I bought from Target was delivered yesterday.  So I contacted Target and they replaced the two orders for free.  But today UPS delivered what they said they delivered yesterday.  So I called Target and said that since the replacements have been shipped I don't mind at all if they charge me for those.  And they said no the replacements that have been shipped are still free.  I am so impressed with Target."
81,0,"I am done with Target.  You can and will be replaced.  I am not a hater of the pride gang and I don't care what people do in their bedrooms,  however, pushing these products front and center amounts to indoctrination of children.  Promoting products designed by a Satanist with Satanist symbols is disgusting for an adult, let alone children.  In addition, promoting ""tuck friendly"" apparel in front of children is another example of indoctrination and grooming.  It offends me and I am tired of it being rammed down my throat.  In addition, your support of organizations that push an anti-American agenda (like the organization that wants to do away with Mount Rushmore, for example) is abhorent.  Stick to business selling products people need, stop pushing your social agendas and LEAVE OUR CHILDREN ALONE!"

2000,0,If I could give their online service 0 stars I would. My sons birthday party is December 7th and it’s a pajama party. I ordered his pajama set off target in the beginning/middle of November. They did not notify me that my package was delayed twice. The package never made it to me but I was refunded. I hope they work on doing a better job with communication and shipping.
312,0,"I have now had two really horrible experiences with trying to order stuff from Target online. In both cases, the total aggravation and, yes, abuse I experienced at the hands of their customer service reps (one of them kept trying to convince me he wasn't ""lying"" even though I never accused him of that or even suggested it to him...) who were either overtly aggressive or just totally uninterested in helping me at all. Orders take forever to arrive, are impossible to track and no one to take any kind of responsibility for it. If and when I ever got what I ordered, it turned out to be a piece of crap and not even worth what I paid for it, not to mention the hassle of ordering it. Even my in-person experiences in the stores has been bad - lots of stuff out of stock or in disarray, incompetent staff and again, a lot more money than the product is worth. So disappointed - I used to be a loyal customer, but no more."

2118,0,"Target online pick up where you pick up in store at customer service desk is horrible. Several times before I go to desk and have to hunt down an employee for customer service. Today was the last straw. Young girl shows up, I give her my license for ID and for her to find my order. Usually they hand the license back right away. This girl so busy to get back to doing other things, never handed me the license. Then she hurried through everything. I am handicap but have no problem handling these orders with my walker. She keeps ratting on about getting a cart. I say NOI! She starts bags off in some direction while I get upset and ask her to give me the bags. I sign that cell phone thing they use these days. She had me all upset and we were away from the counter now. I got home and realized I did not get my driver license back. I call. Customer service phone rings and rings until it calls another number. I ask to speak to a manager. They transfer me to girl who waited on me. She says I left license there. NO. She failed to return the license to me once she looked the order up. She says she's sorry. Are you kidding? I am 70 yrs old and physically handicapped. Now I have to drive back there. A 20 minute drive. I said I would return in morning. My license had better be there.  This is my last time ever shopping at the Target on Norfolk Rd,   W,. Melbourne Fl. They can keep this awful pick up service. I will pay more money elsewhere for the few things I buy there. I will never again use their online pickup service."

1204,0,I ordered 2 leggings online for pick up at a target store near me and payed for it. Target later sent me an email saying that location did not have the item available even thought they said they did and took my money. The order was canceled and I wanted my money back right away and they told me it can take up to a month for my money to come back in to my account. It was target fault they could have said the item was not available but instead said it was and took my money. This is the SECOND time this has happened to me with online ordering and i will never shop with them again. Just say its not available at the store instead of waiting to take the money and say that and make people wait to get the money back.

Have tried customer service many times with no resolution. I just want my money back but have been told I have to wait until the product arrives.I finally got a refund 22nd December. I tried the chat and was disconnected when I got to through, I tried the call centre and was disconnected when I got through. So, it took me lodging a complaint with PayPal and Fair Trading. Target continued to tell me I had to come into the store to process the refund. When I asked Target if it was wise to ask me to come into store when Greater Sydney has been asked to stay home due to COVID, they finally decided they can process a refund remotely."

Funny, how it's always available on pricier items. And they lost my order couple of times last months. Or delivered with 3-4 days delay. And what's up with using huge size boxes for one small item - way to care about environment. Well, thankfully, there are more stores offering same stuff, even without 5% discount. I was a good loyal high amount spending customer and they just forced me to drop them. Whose loss..."
85,0,Why isn’t there a ZERO star option. One star is far too generous! I have shopped at Target for my family of 8 FOR DECADES RELIGIOUSLY‼️ It was my first stop for virtually ALL my needs!

455,0,"This complaint and review of the unfriendly customer service provided by Target online includes a prediction of Target’s future. On June 26, 2022, I ordered a Whirlpool 3.1 cu ft Mini Refrigerator Stainless Steel WH31S1E (Order-9175002949536). The item arrived five days later severely damaged. I contacted what is referred to as Target customer service, and explained the mini refrigerator arrived severely damaged. The representative requested I return the item and to send a new refrigerator to me. I then explained to the representative that I was concerned that a new shipment could possibly be damaged as well due to the poor packaging of the refrigerator. Target sent a second refrigerator and just as I communicated - the second refrigerator arriving damaged.  I then contacted Target again and explained the second refrigerator arrived damaged. Target then offered to discount the refrigerator if I was willing to keep it. My response was that the refrigerator was not as damaged as the first shipment, and I would be willing to keep it at half off the purchase price. Target refused to honor a fifty percent discount and would only reduce the price by thirty percent, for which I refused. Target made arrangements for the refrigerators to be picked up and returned. The pickup was arranged, and the refrigerators were picked up. The pickup order and instructions stated that the refrigerators should be picked up and destroyed. After not receiving a refund for the refrigerator, I contacted Target and requested the order be refunded. The representative explained that a refund could not be processed until they have confirmation of the return. It had been ten days and Target claimed they did not have confirmation of the return and therefore could not process a refund. In conclusion, I found the experience with Target to be extremely poor as nearly every call made to Target resulted in the customer service representatives disconnecting/dropping the call that caused me to have to call back four to five times each time I called. The fact that Target instructed the pickup company to destroy the refrigerator upon pick up speaks clearly as to where Target’s values are after refusing to discount the refrigerator fifty percent due to the item being damaged.  Moreover, my last call to Target requesting the purchase be refunded as the order had been picked up for more than ten days- the representative refused to honor my request to process a refund and rudely stated I must wait thirty days to get a refund and when I showed my dissatisfaction with her lack of customer service and unwillingness to process a refund- the representative again hung up on me. Going forward there is nothing that would cause me to ever shop at a Target store again. And my prediction is, if this is how I was treated, image how many other customers are having similar experiences. I predict Target will be bankrupt and close all its stores and go out of business – all because of its lack of values. In this competitive environment, with such an unfriendly customer policy – Amazon will easily continue to provide exceptional customer friendly service, which will result in the primary reason Target will not survive."

1874,0,"I have used Target live chat three times.  The first time they stopped chatting with me in the middle of me typing because I had so much to say. I guess their system has no patience.  So, I had to start all over. Then, all of the information I told the last chatter I had to repeat. Once again, a lot of information. The most recent time I had to tell the person to have patience because I had a lot to type. Very rude customer service.  I am a millennial, i have patience though. Not all things can be as fast as you would like it. Target chatters need to put themselves in the customers shoes and give us the time we need. I use a lot of their services, but will not anymore if they cannot treat me with respect. I’m a human, not a robot."

1128,0,"I was scammed out of $4400, and target did absolutely nothing to help me. I understand that I fell for the scam and feel extremely stupid about it, but I was hoping as a long time target customer they’d at least try to help me recover SOME of the funds. The scammers tricked me into buying gift cards and giving them the numbers, and I thought maybe target would look at what was purchased from those gift cards and at least reimburse me for the profit they made off those items. They wouldn’t even look into the situation! $4400 is pocket change for a huge corporation like that but for me it was all of my checking and savings. Even if they would’ve given me a small portion of that amount as in store credit at the very least would’ve helped my situation. Being a huge corporation you think they’d want to help their customers, especially when they shop there as much as I USED TO, and being a redcard member. I have no reason not to shop on Amazon now."

She asked me all this info only to tell me, she doesn’t see a Reason given either, and directs me to call target. I call and am finally told my order has “irregularities.”When I requested to know what irregularities from a watch and headphones, ordered from my registered account, paid for by my secure Visa card are blocking this purchase, i was given nothing. As usual, the agent could not assist. Could not answer what’s wrong.

Right now, being a Target customer is like flying Southwest for Christmas 2022. Their systems do not work today. Experience of going into store to pickup an online order is a nightmare (I was trying to save their staff time). Store staff seem unmanaged and ill-trained. I order online from other big box retailers and the order’s ready in 1-2 hrs if not sooner. For Target, maybe 4-6 if you’re lucky, alas. No improvement since holiday crunch either…."
2510,0,"I placed a large clothing order at target.com, which arrived promptly (with 1 item sent in the wrong color).  Two days later, everything went on sale for 20% off.  They refused to do a price adjustment when I called the main customer service #, and told me I'd have to go to the store and return everything and then place a new order to get the 20% off.   Nearest store - 90 miles round trip!  Not only did this cost me greatly in time and frustration - and on a work day yet, but I did place the order again, and with free shipping, that means Target paid to ship these clothes to me TWICE!   Not to mention the time of the employee in the store who had to refund each item I returned.   It was a lose-lose situation.  Target is very disrespectful of a customer's time and is out of touch with common sense.  Also, the clothes ALL came smelling like formaldehyde!!!  I liked some of the clothes, but I'm reading where it's very difficult to get rid of that unhealthy chemical when it's in the clothes -- not like it just comes out on the 1st wash.   I'm fed up with this store, and may return everything on my new order and call it quits with this organization."

I went to pick up an order I had placed online for a gift and the person behind the Returns guest couldn’t find the order and decided to tell everyone standing in line that I hadn’t really placed an order.  I had the order on my phone and then asked to speak to the store manager who was polite and had someone get the item for me.   Before I could leave I needed to pick up a card and wrapping paper.  As I started back to the cashier to pay for those, I saw their security guard, who looked about 16 years old, following me as if I was a thief.  When I asked him about it he at first denied it but then started yelling at me that he was just doing his job.  Why does he need to follow me around the store in order to do his job?  After paying I passed by him again and he started yelling at me to “get out’” getting louder and louder, drawing attention.  I was humiliated and somewhat afraid of physical harm, so I left rather than calling the police as I should have.  I attempted to call after I got home to let the manager know, but no one ever answered the phone.  I did absolutely nothing to deserve this type of treatment.  This was harassment at its worst and I will never go back there again."

I asked to have it received by me on Thursday, but no.  Will not send overnight either.  The explanation was it wasnt shipped due to a technical error.  Why shouldn’t I get special shipping if the error was on their end.  I ordered this 8 days before we were leaving for vacation.  I was offered free shipping (which I already had) with a replacement order, but wouldn’t get it to me in time before we leave.  I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM TARGET AGAIN!!  NEVER"

659,0,target sent me all my orders without the items in the envelope no just that they also sent to wrong address some of items too. very horrible and horrible to purchase from target.com it will be better to put dispute against the charges of target when they are refusing to give our full refund.
1431,0,"Target north haven is a very dirty and poorly managed place. The staff are lacking basic etiquette and are very unfriendly, even hostile. The employees act like your imposing on them when they have to do their job. It is a very hostile environment. I won't shop there again."

2626,0,"Purchased a Total Wireless phone on Cyber Monday at the Champagne, IL Target Store.  The Cyber Monday special was not available for online purchase, which should have been my first red flag.  But needed a phone ASAP, due to my current phone had stopped working that morning.  I drove to the store to pick up the online/cyber Monday special (which was over 50 miles away), to only find out when I got home that the phone was not activated by the cashier.  I called them immediately and they requested that I drive back to the store to have them try to ring it up again.  I could not drive the extra 100 miles that they were asking me to drive, so I offered to send it to them through UPS with a return label for them to ship it back to me.  After far too many calls to check on the status of the phone, I found out that the person that signed for the package, did not get it to management or even the person that was named in care of the package.  This also meant that the return label had disappeared, and the manager had already mentioned that he did not have the ability to ship anything from the store.  He promised to resolve the issue quickly for me and give me a gift card for the my troubles.  One month later, still nothing received from the store - no phone and no call.  Contact them, to receive another promise to address the issue quickly.  Contact them a week later, and ask that they just give me my refund, which they did.  Please do not purchase phones from Target.  They are not capable of successfully enabling phones for use.  Obviously this is a market that they should stay out of; until they are totally capable of understanding the processes that need to happen for the phones they are selling to work properly."
608,0,"Jeeze, found a good price on something. Ordered online for pickup in store. Had to go way out of my way to pick it up (an hour each way). Thank God I looked in the bag when they brought it to me. It was completely the wrong item. The person behind the counter said, ""Oh, they must have substituted."" WHAT? Uh, no, you don't ""substitute."" This was a big waste of my time. Don't ever order anything online from Target. They are clueless and it's shameful."
1063,0,"I purchased 2 Apple Watches Series 6 from the Target website and when the package arrived one item was correct, and one was incorrect (Series 3 Apple Watch). I understand that the warehouse gets the orders wrong and I was understanding of this issue. I went into the North Hills Target Store in Raleigh, North Carolina to return the items but the team leader - Cleo was very rude to me. On the first visit, he refused to refund the items as it “was going to mess the store inventory up” Like I care! He told me to contact customer service. So, I went all the way back home to contact customer service and they told me that these items are only returnable in store and that Cleo advised me incorrectly. So, I went back to the store for the second time and he again refused to return the item. He called customer service and then when he put the phone down, he LIED and said that I need to call them AGAIN and get a pre-paid return label to send the items back to the warehouse. So, I went back home again!I spoke to another customer service advisor - Jenny, who reiterated the same thing that the previous advisor who I spoke to on the phone, that I need to take the items back to the store for a full refund.When I went back into the store for the 3rd time, Cleo said he cannot “serve me or give me a refund” - specifically me. Apparently, his manager Robert said this to him - but Robert was nowhere to be found when I asked for him!He then bought over another manager from the clothing section who didn’t have an idea of what was going on. I heard Cleo bad mouthing me and was talking about me unknowingly that I could hear - calling me a thief and all sorts. He was very unprofessional and was talking about me to the staff near the counter. Check the cameras!!He then stooped so low and was racist towards me and said, “We cannot serve people like you” (I can also go into why America think Black people are ignorant because that is how black people speak to customers like myself. But they wouldn’t like it if someone spoke to them like that!) This shouldn’t be about racism but unfortunately, Cleo was xenophobic towards me as an Asian person. Disgusting behaviour!!!This wasted half day of my work time and I lost half a day’s salary, so I need reimbursing for my time wasted and I want action taken on Cleo for racism, discrimination, and unprofessionalism."

I asked for his boss and I got Dee and she was extremely rude no customer service did not care spoke over me constantly . What a horrible customer service experience., she could care less At the complete lack of service I was given and gave me no options as to how to rectify the situation; it was her way or no way ..,again no customer service at all.

Are all white girls going to just fall apart an give up on believing they can succeed?  Of course not.  Its as if just any little thing you can find to complain about when it regards race, you feel you must.  What if it said white girl instead of black?  In your heart, you know that's ridiculous.  What if it was white girls who'd had their grandpa lynched in the 30s, 40s, or 50s?My only complaint about Target is that it doesn't have enough plus sized clothing.  Speaking as a plus-sized WHITE woman."
1426,0,I shop at the Target near Golf Mill Mall and was treated very rude by the employees. I was asked to check my purse that I just bought at Target as if I was stealing.

2001,0,"Customer service is very frustrating. I ordered two pieces of furniture and received a receipt which stipulated a pick up date. On that day I went to receive the furniture and they told me it would take another week to arrive. The person I was talking to quickly diverted blame by saying 'you ordered on x so it will be here on y'. I had to point out to them that no, I have a document from you which says otherwise. This defensiveness is not only unprofessional but extremely irritating. If the eta stipulated on the receipt is incorrect why not send a message to let the customer know? Why put it there in the first place? Why act like a ponce and divert blame? I would be a lot less frustrated if the customer service person said 'ahh yes, this seems to be our fault - I'm sorry for the delay but it will be here on x'. Such a needlessly frustrating experience where the company refuses to admit that the goods I ordered are late!"
2624,0,"I ordered an ipad this year on Dec 24 to ship to a store nearby. It says the item will arrive Dec 29-Jan 2. Since I am only on a trip here until the 2nd, I figured that would give it just enough time. BUT NO. The website sneakily updated the arrival date to Jan 4 a few days later. I called customer service to ask where the ipad was, and nobody seemed to have an idea. I said I would not be able to pick up after Jan 2, the staff offered to re-order a new ipad for me honoring my original price (it was on sale during christmas) and ship to Hong Kong for me for free. Great. Then I had to talk to two more people of different departments, only to be told that since they don't ship digital items internationally anymore, there's no way they can do that for me. I asked if I can get any reimbursement in one form of another for my lose (shipping to HK by a friend) and the frustration in all this, she just flat out rejected me. Really? This is the shittest retail store there ever is on earth. Big fat corporate mongol lying and stealing hard-earned money from our pockets. I wish they go bankrupt ASAP. NEVER SHOP THERE, unless you want a load of troubles and have extra cash to drop."

1541,0,"The direction of your politics in this store has reached an all new low. I see Target going bankrupt if you choose to keep Chrissy Teigen as a spokes person. This woman is an atrocity to representing woman and she never has anything nice to say. Keep letting her open her mouth an destroy your company. I will NEVER shop in your store until she is fired!!! I will be posting on social media as well how she likes to degrade the first lady, when the first lady does more for woman and children then Chrissy could ever be. Shame on you guys for allowing such a crude individual speak on behalf of your company."
2174,0,"I recently went shopping at the Target in Miltown, Nj and was met with a very unwelcoming feeling. I dont know what the policy in ""watching"" customers in the store is but from the time I set foot in the store until my appalling self check out experience where I was hovered over. While other patrons were not monitored as closely. I made my purchase and left. I got in the car a realized that if Target was going to treat me like a suspicious suspect  then they didn't need my suspicious dollars and went back and returned everything. FYI while you watching me there was someone actually stealing but they did have my particular look. No more target for me and my family"
2309,0,Target has always been my go to the prices and fair and there are many stackable ways on saving with coupons and cartwheel (their mobile app.) not to mention their customer services is  impeccable on the phone. In stores there are less interactive but will help you if you ask. Im quite surprised it has so many bad reviews i would definitely say try another location.
2341,0,Need to offer discount to scan your own items.  Very few cashiers open so I went to the scan your own.  EVERYONE HAD ISSUES SCANNING THEIR OWN!!!!

981,0,All of my orders have been processed fast. Free shipping is great. You can tell they are really trying to be customer service oriented. I had a couple items that were broken during shipping.

1838,0,"Target at Glendale is one of the worst stores I have ever been. The cashiers and managers are super slow and rude! I have been getting my wic checks from here but every time there are issues and they do Not want to solve the existing problems at the store. There is no enough wicable stuff and when the system does not accept the item chosen, on the registers they do not accept to give you not wicable stuff. They do not respect the fact of being a loyal customer and that you have already wasted your time there. Not helpful staff at all! 👎👎👎specially the manager called ‘Vicente’ has been really stubborn and not helping!!!! He brought me rice instead of bread. Even though I let him know that I need bread with my wic check he kept insisting on his and I asked him to accompany me so that I could show him that the wic sign is not there he ignored me! He just said you call them and talk to them. I can’t do anything."

580,0,"I am really disappointed in target’s customer service. I ordered a target pick up order on Feb 8. I ordered two curtain panels. They gave me two different curtains, one was the one I ordered while the other was completely wrong. I did a return through the app and they were supposed to send me the correct panel. I received it in the mail today and it was the right style but wrong color. How many times will they get my order wrong? I would expect customer service to do something other than “send me the right panel” again, like maybe a refund or expedited shipping, but this was not the case. Target step up your game and hire people who pay attention to detail!"
2039,0,"Online experience is great and the app is super helpful. The app even tells you the location by aisle in your local store. I love that I can check in-store availability and BOPUS if need be to ensure I receive an item that's low in stock.My only negative is that not every item is available for drive up, and I'm not just talking about fresh food items. Makeup and items that might take a long time to find on a display is often not available for drive-up orders."
2419,0,"Target claims to be customer service oriented. Neither Target nor its roboticly trained staff can legitimately claim that. This morning when picking up 3 of the 4 items I'd ordered online, I asked the staff member what would have happened if I had waited till the 4th item had arrived for collection, to pick up the first 3 items. I was told the first 3 items would have been sent back to the warehouse and my order cancelled.I pointed out that imposes the burden on me, the customer, to make 2 visits to the Target store for the one order. I asked, ""How is that good customer service?""The staff member replied, ""That's the Target system.""I asked, ""Shouldn't she seek to initiate a change to the system to deliver better customer service?""The answer was an indifferent shrug of the shoulders.My response will be to shop at Target as little as possible, as to both Target and its staff, the customer exists primarily for their.I shall never respond to a Target survey request as their surveys exist only to create a perception of customer caring, rather than supporting an intent to improve their staff, systems and service. I shall urge all others to do likewise."

I read Target's coupons policy and I was in the right and Abraham was in the wrong. I called the Target main office and they are sending me a gift card for my troubles but I am so upset! This man, Abraham, should NOT be a manager of a store. What an awful, embarrassing situation! I will NEVER shop at yhe Niles location again.."

2136,0,"I feel very disheartened by Target the pass several times I have been there in person; as well, I feel equally sadden by Target.com. It feels like Target is losing their moral grounding, reputation for friendliness and their strive to make things right with customers. I have been called “a fraud” and “a thief” in store by a customer service employee for somehow “manipulating their very own app” to show a price from Target.com that was different from the price in store. I don’t even know how one would go about doing that. Honestly, I don’t even know how one has time in a day to do something like that. I don’t even have time to drink a full cup of coffee most mornings! And If a person did know how to do that, I can’t see why they would go after Target for a lousy $5 dollars. To top it off, this employee did it in front of my two kids. She was very rude and aggressive. I mean, to the point that my son was sincerely worried and anxious about ever going back to Target again. When I addressed this with Target’s corporate customer service, the lady was very friendly. However, that was it. I never heard from the store. I never received an apology of any kind. Nothing. Not even an insincere automated email simply reading “Sorry you had a bad experience at our store. We hope you give us another chance.” In the end, I let it go and gave Target another chance. Well, that was dumb.Upon shopping at Target after the incident, I have been talked about, very loudly and again in front of my kids, by employees. It has been made known that I am not wanted there when certain employees are working now. Considering this Target is understaffed, that makes me unwelcomed every single day. I have been given nasty looks. I have been treated like I was a criminal/intruder by some staff (not all, please know), for the fact that I reported the issue and behavior. Let me say, I reported it as I did not think a corporation with the reputation and classiness of which I held Target at should go unaware of actions and behaviors in the magnitude that was represented that day; additionally, the lady that I had the interaction with actually told me to report her! She very much insisted that I report her! She even spelled her name out for me, followed by “when you report me, make sure you have my name spelled right.” Yeah, she was that horrible of a person—definitely not a person for customer service, perhaps nighttime stocking. This continuous behavior by Target employees makes me wonder...Why is/was this allowed to be a thing among employees? Why was this issue even discussed around other Target employees by either the lady that I had the interaction with and/or management? Why was she not told to be professional and keep it between management and herself? Furthermore, why was she not told that if she did gossip about it, certain actions would be taken? It all just blows my mind. Since then, I’ve had a few other incidents, but I’ve not thought twice about them. I chalked them up as someone having a bad day. It happens. No big deal. I’ve also ignored the feces always all over the women’s bathroom; the coupon by a product that was left for another customer to hopefully use, still laying there 2+ weeks later, letting me know that nothing has been cleaned or stocked. The dusty and obviously broken items on display to be sold. I’ve ignored the price discrepancies from app to store (yes, I understand they are different entities), that the store refused to honored—I am not referring to myself on this, either. I’ve forgiven the long lines; the completely bare shelves for weeks to months on end; the nonexistent concern for employees, themselves, by Target; and I’ve even let go the times that I’ve ordered for store pick up, only to find that items were cancelled from my order without giving me a warning or option to replace them with something else. And even then, I was not told they were cancelled. I had to discover it on my own. Then there is today. I had ordered an item through the app that wasn’t available in store. My account read delivery would be today by 8pm. We spent all day long waiting for the item. It was for our two children, age 5 and 4. By about 5pm, when it still hadn't shown, we took the kids to the store itself to waste time and distract them from their eager anticipation. (Side story: while there, we found someone’s wallet and keys that we immediately took to the front desk/customer service. Walking up, I try to hand it to a Target employee, only to rudely be told “I’m off the clock and on break. That’s not my job, and I’m not allowed to deal with this stuff off the clock anyways.” She then proceeded to walk in front of us to the service desk and clock in to work it! I’m not sure which was worse, the attitude of the employee, or the idea that Target May literally tell their employees that they cannot help with placing lost wallets and keys at the front desk, even if clocking in to do the very job that handles this type of stuff. Way to display/encourage acts of simple kindness, Target. You’re definitely a special breed these days.) Anyways, back to the original story. We got home at 8pm to find no package. My account still read the same day and time; however, upon investigating further, I found out (yes, again, all on my own; no help or courtesy from Target) that it was going to be 2-3 days late. Angry, no. Not yet. I was, however, disappointed in the lack of care, concern, and simple professionalism that was entangled with the fact that Target could not even have been bothered to let us know the arrival was changed. I typically wouldn’t have been, but this was breaking my kids heart. It wasn’t something that I, as an adult, could cope without for a few more days. That would have been an entirely different situation. It was to help my children feel “at home” upon our millionth move with the military. In turn, I looked up what I was supposed to do. Target’s website said to contact them in these situations. I did just that. I wasn’t harsh or unfriendly either. Honest. Why would I be? It wasn’t the person on the other end’s fault. What did end up being the person’s fault was how they purposely changed the date in my account to accommodate Target! Yep! Honest. Thankfully I had already taken pictures for proof prior to the conversation. The service rep even said “look at your order now. What’s it reading?” Could you be any more bluntly indirect about the sneaky manipulative actions that you just engaged in?! To top it off, they simply ended the conversation with me out of nowhere. I hadn’t even had a chance to be mean, if I wanted. When I contacted Target back to tell them what happened, that representative hung up on me! What kind of company allows their very own customer service, both in store and online, to treat people in such a blatant crude way? I know the answer, the kind of company that Target has turned into, sadly. I did contact Target once more, again not rude. I even started the conversation by apologizing that I had some negative things to relay about my experience. End result, Target couldn’t do anything about my order delivery (understood. It was beyond their control); they wouldn’t compensate in any way for the error; and they did not have someone I could talk to about any issues whatsoever, but they would put my comments in the notes. Ha! I’ve been there before with you Target; I’m not falling for that again! It’s sad. Even Amazon and Walmart will compensate for shipping issues. Heck, I had a negative encounter with an employee at Walmart not long ago, not even a huge one and no management brought into it; and yet, surprisingly, the manager called me the very next day personally to apologize, gave me a $25 gift card, and then left me yet another apology note attached to the gift card that read very sincere. The very same Walmart that people make jokes about being trashy and rude. Well, from where I’m standing, Walmart has way more class and heart than Target does. I used to associate Target with kindness, humanity, and core values that were rare to find in any company. Now, I wonder what type of cruel and hypocritical practices Target is implementing and encouraging. Target is becoming a disgrace. And truth be told, I feel like I’m grieving over the Target that I once dedicated loyalty to. I say this from several angles, faucets, and experiences. The company as a whole should take a step back and reevaluate the direction the brand is going in, because I’m seeing more and more people with the same stories and outlook as myself. It’s a shame. A very real and unfortunate shame. Looks like Walmart and other competitors alike will be gaining their customers back, quickly and steadily.Oh! And the reason for 2 stars instead of just one (or none) is this...while it’s been a miserable year dealing with Target, I must admit that there are some employees at my local store that are absolutely phenomenal! They are the only reason I even walk into that store anymore. I wish more employees were like the handful that I’ve come to know and adore. If not for them, I’d have rated  Target with no stars at all."

So i called and ""oh yes its ready, come get it"" thanks for the heads up. We should have taken the hint from that experience, but gave target.com another chance. Made an order that said ""confirmation email within 2 hours""  NEVER RECEIVED THE EMAIL not that i expected one at this point, went into the store hoping it was ready, only to be told that, ""oh we dont have those, you have go to this other store that is 40 miles away to get it...then that store says "" we do these in the order that we recieve them, it could be a few hours.... i looked around....im the ONLY ONE HERE. THERES NO ONE ELSE HERE TO PICK ANYTHING UP!!! NO ONE! even the service desk is dead!  So i have to wait HOURS for you to process the orders, of people who arent here? So i made a discovery, theres a ""cancel order"" button that makes the idiocy go away, it took me 4 minutes to walk to the electronics grab what i needed, pay and leave..... now ask me if im ever going back?? *never*"
1459,2,Love target! I would give 5 stars but the fact they aren’t allowing returns during Covid is the reason why. Customers shop in the store but they won’t let u return or exchange anything due to contamination but people walk in and out without gloves and masks and contaminate the store. I work in the medical field knowing protocol and this one just makes no sense-it contradicts everything.

2316,0,"Purchased bed sheets and a duvet cover with 2 day shipping included, it got to the day when they were supposed to arrive and they didn’t.  I called target customer service and the lady who spoke very broken english said they were having trouble locating the items as they have been discontinued and they had to locate them in another warehouse, but Target w is still selling them on their site.   She said my items wouldn’t be going out until monday which is a full week after my order was made.   I asked if they were going to give me a discount and she said they would give me a five dollar gift card on a $150+ order.  I said that was unacceptable and to cancel that order plus an additional order, she said she was unable to cancel my order...that had not shipped yet... I asked to speak to a manager and she said none was available.  I called my bank and dispute the charges and will never shop at target again... The lady I spoke with said her name was “Jan” and did nothing but give me attitude."
217,2,"Called target.com for being overcharged.  Spoke with a manager who was already annoyed answering the phone- I was more polite and cheery than she was.  Explained my situation.  She told me there was nothing she could do and demeaned my comments.  I was respectful and stated my experience to her clearly and calmly.  When I proceeded to ask more questions, she continue to speak over me repeatedly saying ""maam, there's nothing else I can do to resolve this issue, we're done here"" Then I tried to speak again and she repeated the phrase on my 2nd word in.  Over and over, 3 times she repeated this phrase while I was speaking as I tried to ask her another question.  Zero emotional stability and zero solutions-oriented ""manager"".  She should not be a manager at all.  I finally stopped talking and she said, ""is there anything else I can help you with today?""  When I said yes, she hung up on me.  Worst service I've ever experienced with any company.  I'm done with target for good.  I don't need to be abused while spending my money somewhere.  I'm shopping at Amazon and other specialty stores from now on that treat their customers with kindness."

1796,2,"I have always liked Target, however the recent racist Honey Pot commercial has changed my opinion. Honey Pot might be a great product but I will not support such blatant racism. I find the commercial very offensive. It would have been fine if she had just said the next person, instead the commercial is both sexist and racist! Bad move Target!"
803,0,I ordered some place mats supposed to have been delivered yesterday. Checked tracking number thru Fedex and only information is it left Los Angeles 6-19. I called Fedex and got a recording that my package was enroute to post office for delivery. Spoke to a person at Fedex and he claims it left Los Angeles 6-19 and is enroute. Are you freaking kidding me? Target's big problem is they need to find a better shipping company. I prefer to buy the product at the store.Target doesn't keep anything in stock and doesn't allow you to buy the display. You have to order it online. WHY?
1649,2,Target's brick and mortar stores have always been excellent and they have great products.  The call center is horrible.  They will talk to you any way and I mean ANY way. I have been told to shut up when I call in for assistance.  I have worked in call centers so I make sure that I talk to people with respect.  If it was not for the customer service in the stores I would have closed my card and never shop there again.
63,0,I bought a watermelon cut it open and it is extremely nasty inside and they refuse to let me get a new one. Ridiculous customer service .
2024,0,VERY IMPORTANT!!Customer beware of ordering online and driving up or in store pickup. They say that the item is in the store Available and when I ordered 5 items to my cart and paid for everything online everything was good until I pulled up to get my items and it said 2 items they didn't have so I'll be refunded in 7-14 days for items they stated were in the store. Big scam don't be fooled by their new deal drive up is a joke just have to go into the store from now on because they are making money off of the items that were not Available after I purchased them. What a joke!!
1987,0,"I never thought I’d say this but I’m shocked and so disappointed by the poor customer service I have just received from Target. I bought a media console on Black Friday (after spotting the price since weeks) from one of my favorite vendors, Opal House, and when trying to install it many pieces were missing. I’ve spent 1 hour trying to reach the right person to address this and after 3 transfers I finally talked to someone who wanted me to drop off the piece and refund me. They did arrange for UPS to come pick it up, and I was grateful for it, but now I have lost my discounted price and this is not ok. I’m so upset about how poorly this service has been. I loved Target but this has definitely changed my perception."

1578,0,"To whom it may concern: If you are one of those people that left those uneducated and highly racist comments about the honey pot products - Thanks for outing yourself as an ignorant, racist tool. It’s always good to know how many of you exist and who to avoid in this world. To be offended by something as encouraging and necessary as that commercial- it proves you have a heart full of hate and way too much time on your hands. Get over yourself and become a better person. Get educated.  Warm regards, Someone who doesn’t go through the world full of hate (except for you racist dinguses*) *because I’m not allowed to use ‘inappropriate language’"
2565,0,"Horrible customer service, un professional management. I bought my stuff online, after receiving email "" order is ready to pick up""Employee didn't find the stuff, that was removed from slot. After calling ten people& 40 minutes wait. Manager shows up & told me that she will give me 1/3 of my order that Already I paid in full, because she just want to keep rest of on store for other customers. If u are brwon any one stop u to buy any thing in store. Because store is run by white red necks. U can not buy any regular price or clearance product either.I got stopped twice before. This is 3rd time make me write online."
2171,0,"Target has it all. Their prices are very competitive and if you have their credit card you get 5% off your total purchase right up front. The y run specials that will reward you with Target gift cards if you buy the promoted merchandise. Shipping is free if you buy $35 in product. No yearly charge for Prime customers. You can also order online and pick up the order usually in a couple hours. If you know what you want just shop at home, drive to the store and they will bring it out to your car. Great service."
2258,0,"Recently made a purchase on Targets baby registry. The way it works is if more than one person is chipping in for one item you pay into what Targrt calls E-gifter. The item will ship once it is completly paid for. That's what we thought anyway. Went to make final payment and the debited bank account entire cost of the product then shipped it. Called their lame customer care and got absolutely no where. Apparently, when the item is paid the register will get a gift card emailed to them and then they buy the item. This is the stupest thing I ever heard of. This means that if you need to return item you would only get a giftcard back. Good riddance Target!!!"
2003,0,So Disappointed! Ordered Lego Friends Advent Calendar because it said it would be delivered Dec. 2 but now my poor granddaughter is disappointed as it says it won't arrive before the 10th. That's half way through the daily gift idea. I would have ordered from somewhere else had the order page been honest.
612,0,"Their online and phone customer service is the worst!What happened, I thought Target was supposed to be good.Big companies really don’t care and the wonder why that can get people to work for them.Shop small and local!"
498,0,"Placed an order on Target.com and it arrived quickly. Within the timeframe it gave. Products arrived in separate bags and everything was accurate. In store, my experience is also good. Although I spend more than I want. Ha! Also, have done the curbside pickup and that was awesome! Thank you for having this as an option!"
521,0,Can waste a lot of time looking around Target.  Love it.
539,0,"Beware, the Target site will tell you something will be delivered by a certain date and then it changes. Better off going with Amazon or to another store to shop on line."
707,0,"I had a terrible experience ordering online for Target, and I want to encourage others to think twice before ordering. I was double charged multiple times and was told it was a “holding fee,” even though there were multiple charges with different amounts. After waiting 45 minutes on hold to get in contact with a customer service rep, I was told that they “couldn’t see” where I was charged different amounts for items I didn’t order. When my order finally arrived (2 days late may I add), the box looked like it had been beaten with a bat. I can’t post pictures of it on this site or I would. I ended up having to call my bank, get refunds on the fraudulent transactions, and file claims. I would have just made a trip to the store if I knew this would be such a hassle."
2478,0,"OMG! haven't been to target in awhile but the clothing lines are terrible the shoes are horrible and i will never shop there for clothing again.i will not be surprised if they close the doors,there's clearance clothes everywhere and i did try on a pair of jeans they don't fit right.what a shame"
1527,0,"I am in shock at this company, they blocked me from paying my card payment online and then made me miss a payment making it late, my score then dropped 100 points!! I was in the process of getting a house. I've always been on time with my payments, and they completely screwed me, do not get the target redcard! I disputed it last month, they told me they would get ahold of the credit bureaus and fix things, well guess what, 1 month later it's still on my credit and I can't qualify to buy a house for my kids and me🙁"
481,0,"I needed an air compressor. Two employees did not help. The 3rd person I asked to help me was Christina at the Ward Parkway store. She went out of her way to locate the air compressor for me.  I appreciate her excellent customer service. Thank you, Christina at Target."
605,0,"I ordered a faux plant on Dec. 6.  It was to be delivered Dec. 19th. It was for a Christmas gift.  It didn't arrive by the 24th so I had to go to another store on Christmas eve. (They had the same plant presented in a nicer pot for $5 less.)When I spoke to Target CS they told me they would not refund my money unless it arrived and then I should wait on line at a store to get my money back.   If it never arrived I would not get a refund.It finally arrived on Dec. 26.  The box was much smaller than the item.  Since it didn't fit in the box whole, the glass pot was broken into about 6 pieces and some shards of glass that cut my hands as I opened it.   Since it was damaged they did offer a refund which I am still waiting for."
1465,0,"Purchased an item.  One defective part found after complete assembly.  I am not returning the item to just have to buy another and assemble it.  Manufacturer does not respond to defective part notice.  Target:  No way to reach customer service other than by phone with an hour plus wait time.  That's not customer service.  It's disservice.  I feel like the the Target is on my back, but I am fighting back.  This review is stage 1."
1583,2,These sad comments by misguided white people are the epitome of white fragility.I am white and have enough sensitivity and intelligence to understand what racism is and to acknowledge its widespread effects.  Bolstering a group of people which has been (and still is) systematically discriminated against is NOT racism.I praise Target for running this ad and wish all the best to this company!
173,0,"TARGET, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NO MORE SHOPPING IN YOUR STORES.GOOD BYE"
522,0,Don't buy Garden products from Target.I bought a Broadcast spreader that doesn't work. They will not take back or give credit . Just said Too bad .Terrible experience
1503,0,This is the worse experience I ever had. I placed this order more than a week ago and as of today I still missing the most import item which is the toothpastes. I placed this order online because of the COVID-19 to avoid going in person to the store and FEDEX has knocks to my door more than 7 times with different shipments. In addition to that some of the items were delivered to a different location. I have not words to explain how disappointed I feel about my experience buying in target this time. I am definitely not going to try this option again plus not going back to any other Target store.
2104,0,Location: Las Vegas East (702) 438-8866I shop at Target very often. I participate in the sales example spend $50 get a $10 giftcard or buy 4 get a $5 giftcard. I like to stock up on house supplies so I don't have to buy them often. I thought it was a great deal until I discovered that they are charging for the giftcard as apart of your purchase. And you never notice. I have the receipts to prove it. You add up each item including your supposedly FREE giftcard and you will see the total matches and if the giftcard was FREE as promised it should NOT be reflected in your amounted total that you pay. These type of promotions are a scam. If you add up your purchase you will realize that the giftcard ( that are supposed to be FREE) are apart of your purchase and who knows how many times they have scammed us all. I thought this deal was honest. Please people check your receipts. After discovering being charged I had the hardest time being refunded back the amount of the supposedly FREE gift card. After my horrible experience I will NO LONGER be shopping at TARGET for anything. How is it right for honest paying customers to be charged for something that is supposed to be FREE with your purchase?
1599,0,"I see that Target is now a supporter of reverse discrimination. The Honeypot commercial is obviously racist.  If Target does not believe it to be racist, I challenge them to run a commercial that would implicate that one of their products is for ""white girls"" who have a dream of starting their own company. I have spent lots of money at Target during my life. I will never spend another cent with them after seeing this. I will be cutting up my Target card today."
1864,0,It's got everything you need. They need to up their game though.
830,0,"This was literally the worst experience I have ever had. Target ruined my daughter's Birthday by canceling an order I paid for, that had a tracking code up until the day of delivery.  They have absolutely no remorse and gave a 30 gift card to ruin an 11 year Olds day!!! Way to go Target, let's not forget she's going blind and has little to no time left with her vision to enjoy her canceled switch... I hope Target CEO reads this and rots!!! Yucky..."
1869,0,"I always have trouble with their CartWheel app, why not just offer the discounts across the board to everyone?"
2078,0,"I literally shop at Target between 5 and 6 times a week in Houston, We own an all girl after school and dance program in the Heights in Houston. We go there to get coffee, food for the girls everyday. Cleaning products, party accessories and since I own a nonprofit they often donate to my community events. It's a win win with Target. Prices are good and they pay it forward💜💜"
1152,0,I pre ordered Xbox series X. I get an email saying I don’t get it day one. I get it up to 2 weeks later. Seriously? Then why the heck did I order it?Should have went Best Buy. They allowed pick up and also the delivery arrived ON THE LAUNCH DAY. So no excuses Target. This is the last time I pre order anything from you!!
1064,0,"Visited TARGET at Selma, TX today (Sunday). The crowded parking lot should have been sufficient warning. There were teems of full families streaming into the store which was already crowded. There was NO SOCIAL DISTANCING and NO attempts by management to monitor or  to control the crowd, or adherence to any health safety guideline. I abandoned my visit for the sake of SAFETY and SANITY. Classic example of more interest in PROFITS than PUBLIC SAFETY. Of course the PUBLIC werent helping the situation either."
748,0,"Online and in store customer service is terrible! After a really bad experience, I filled out the survey they sent asking about my interaction and checked the box saying I wanted to be contacted. They never contacted me about this. But months later I got a letter asking if I lost my red card since I was no longer shopping there. That is the ultimate in corporate greed: can't be bothered to contact an upset customer but you darn well still want my money! I will gladly spend more money elsewhere for items Target sells cheaper at stores that actually appreciate me as a customer!"
781,0,I went to the electronics section to purchase a new phone. The tech was in the back doing inventory. One of the associates went into the back to ask him  to  come  to  the  desk  to  assist  me. After waiting g several  minutes  the  associate  returned to tell me they rid not have the phone I  wanted in stock. The tech never came out to talk with me. A sale lost. Had he come out to talk to me about other phones available I  may have bought a new phone while I was there!
1673,2,"Honey Pot worked so well for me! It's an amazing product and its natural! It's crazy how people are hating on this product for being RaCisT. It's probably because society hates seeing a black entrepreneur and saying ""the next black girl"" is offensive. It's not racist. She never said any white girl should not use this product or it's only for black girls. Everybody is hating to see black girls/women in the center of attention. Yes, all lives matter. But at this moment black lives matter is a big trend right now. Please stop hating because they said ""the next black girl"" if it was a white person nobody would say anything. I'm an African-American TEEN who's writing this right now. You guys shouldn't be disgusted at the inspiring commercial for black people in general, but yourselves responding disgustingly to the commercial."
2375,0,"I ordered a gift off the website that said guaranteed in time for Christmas.  I later got a notification that it would be delayed and not arrive on time. Very upset I called customer service and she said she could not do anything about it. I expressed to her that if you can not guarantee something by the date the website should not say otherwise.  She went on to tell me she would have the product overnighted to me as soon as she could with no additional cost.  That was a lie.  The product was shipped out and not on an over night shipment.  I have since received two additional updates saying the package will be delayed further and now I will not receive the product until December 30th. This is completely unacceptable and upsetting as this was a Christmas gift for someone. I am extremely disappointed and will be taking my business elsewhere, because it is obvious Target can not keep up with the other stores with shipping and customer service."
820,0,I purchased a Tri fold for my son's project at the Target in Pembroke. I received an email saying the order was ready for pickup. When I arrive I parked in the drive up parking. It was a young African American employee bringing the orders to the cars. I was the only car waiting in the parking space and she over looked my  car and serviced the cars that arrived after me. When I saw her helping the other customers I lowered my window to get her attention she said I was yelling across the parking. She then scanned the barcode for the item. The manager Rachel came to my car and I expressed my disappointment about their customer service. Rachel blew me off and said that she would address my concerns with their employee she was rude and had very bad attitude. The service at Target is horrible.
685,0,I bought 3 pack of Target women's socks. I wore one pair. Second pair had big hole in toe. Cannot return!
1397,0,Target has all the essentials for your house and cute decor. I’ve bought a few cute pieces of clothes but nothing special. Fun place to go poke around in.
2550,0,Target used to be a good place to shop but they change the way they do things they used to have the products out around 8 to 9 a. M now when you go in there they will have the item on the truck but depends on what you are looking for they told me if I wanted to wait around for it might be maybe 2 hours because they don't have a crew in the morning unloading trucks which is kind of stupid you looking for stuff and all of these carts and boxes are in the way I don't know what idiot thought that was a good idea I guess when you go to college and get a degree you get stupid if you can't fix stupid
101,0,"I've shopped at Target for years. I'm politically a  moderate, though that never factored into my buying habits until now. I want good quality, price, and customer service from Target, NOT socio-political activities that half of their customers now have concerns about. For example, we don't let minors vote or drive for a reason. Their brains aren't fully developed, their choices aren't always sound, yet Target supports letting minors - even little kids, choose their gender, and these kids often do this with nudges from teachers or parents who want to be trendy or ""sensitive"". Target helps fund an organization that wants places like Mount Rushmore to be dismantled or blown up and all national property, like Yosemite, to be given to native peoples or redistributed. This same Target-supported organization says that the US Military ""stole"" the land that it has bases on in foreign countries and that they should be closed. This and other nonsense are really problematic. Do I still want to shop here? As an aside, all of these extreme left goals are supported mainly by young far left liberals. Target has a history of not hiring older people who apply for jobs, and has been sued for this more than once. A coincidence? I think not. Having older employees would ""dilute the culture""."
105,0,I will NEVER shop at another one of your satanic stores ever again! I cut my red card into pieces and wont be using that again. How dare you promote this disgusting filth to our children. Tuck and blind clothing in children’s sizes? What tf is wrong with you??? I saw the books you had on display for 4-8 year olds. Really Target? Books teaching them about drag and blowies? I hope the CEO reads each and every one of these comments and hangs his head in shame. Or maybe he’s a Satan worshiper too? I can’t wait to see this corporation crumble. I’m going to help make that happen along with my entire family and friends!
1387,0,Lure you into spending the $35.00 for 2 day shipping...ordered on Monday SUPPOSED to be here Thursday...which worked out perfect for me but yet everytime I track my packages it gets pushed back a day! Now I know why I usually don't buy from here.

2468,0,"30 MINUTES ???? That's all you getThat's all you get. Realize you made a mistake or change your mind at 31 mins, to bad.I sent the item to the wrong address. 3 different orders. One was sent to the wrong address.  I was told I have to wait for a tracking number.  Then TRY to get the address changed with the delivery service.  2 tracking numbers were emailed to me.  I'm still waiting for the one I need. It's been two days. It was the first one I ordered. Online customer service says there is nothing they can do.REALLY!  Go into your system change the address! It can be done. REALLY, 30 mins! I called less then one hour after I placed the order! Target needs to remember who is paying their bills.UPDATE.........I received a tracking number Monday evening.I called FEDEX.  They said a change of address needs to be done through the seller. I explained to them that the seller gives a 1-800 # for the delivery service and told me it has to go through the delivery service. Long story short. FEDEX ROCKS!!!!!!!THANK YOU FEDEX, Kimberly and Wilmer. The package will arrive at the right address and on the original date."
2060,0,"Target is horrible. All of my shopping items were stolen and I waited an hour for the management to refund my money! I was treated horrible, alwhile handling my autistic 3 year old! I called customer service was dropped twice during call transfers to que again. Finally talked with a nice rep just for him to transfer me upward to a supervisor named Natasha who was snotty one who refused to help compinsate for my time, loss of purchase!! So sorry to spend my money at a worthless overall overpriced going down like Kmart - target"

1350,0,"I’ve always had really good experiences when in Target stores . The Target at Bayshore Gardens in Bradenton Florida is very clean and despite COVID19 they have “ products “ stocked but at a limited to 1:1 and may sell out sooner than before COVID19 .All sales associates are very courteous and wear face masks. But my favorite is the Target APP. I can get the best prices on my favorite household essentials and a wide range of ECO friendly products shipped via 2 day shipping , delivered via same day delivery or pick up at store. But the best for me is opening the app and pulling up my “ list” and seeing if my item is #1) in stock #2) what isle it’s in . This saves me much time and energy. The only thing I would rate low is the in store ( near me) would be the women’s clothing styles. I’m originally from Chicago Illinois and therefore am accustomed to more new off the runway styles. So the clothing styles in bradenton Target are not up to par for my personal taste, however better styles can be found online . The trick is to get it before everyone else. The kids section on the other hand is great. If you’re a conservative mother of a little girl , this store is for your daughter . You won’t be finding jeans ripped up near the “ private areas” that look like somebody painted on . The Target app is also very easy to navigate and has ( green products) section in the household essentials part which is another plus."

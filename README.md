The transition from numbers to alphabets was a quantum leap for computing. It allowed programmers to go from assembly language that allowed users to simply code in 1’s and 0’s, to creating methodologies that allowed programmers to code in an easier to understand and a much more transferable language quite similar to english. 

A similar leap in AI was the machine’s ability to understand words and map them directly to their meaning. This allowed systems to grasp the “context” of a sentence and thereby predict which word came next. This is the basic structure of language models. Such models are a probabilistic approach to predicting the next word or term in a sequence of words or a sentence. Simply put, language models predict the likelihood of some word that will appear next in a sentence. The overall process here can be broken down into the following steps:



1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Understand the word:</span> Many languages contain numerous words that may mean the same thing or to make things more difficult, mean completely different things based on the context. This brings us to the next step
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Understand the context:</span> Different contexts can decide the tone of a sentence, its structure or even its meaning.
3. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Predict the likelihood:</span> A self explanatory step, but a complex one, predicting the likelihood of the next word involves converting the above two steps into numbers.

Steps 1 and 2 require a model to understand rather abstract concepts. In the context of this article (hehe, context) abstract refers to any concept that cannot be translated directly into plain and easy-to-understand numbers. These five give rise to qualitative metrics.

For an AI to make sense of it all, everything has to come down to numbers. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of AI - it can accomplish the most complex tasks possible all by deconstructing these phenomena into plain and simply statistical inference. 

This project aims to utilize the above concept to conduct a sentiment analysis study on customer reviews related to Target, an American retail organization. The reviews under study were scraped from TrustPilot, an online platform where customer reviews are accessible to the public.

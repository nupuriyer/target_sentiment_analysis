1968,0,"Horrible customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!! South Shore Plaza aka Braintree Mall Target is one of the worst I have ever been to. I went to pick up an online huggies pamper order that was placed a day prior and it still wasnt ready. The customer service person who helped me kept replying ""Sorry not sure what happened theres nothing I can do, do you just want to cancel the order"" instead of finding out where the pampers were. When I asked for a manager she informed me they were all busy. I def will not be visiting that store again."
1037,0,"The worst service ever. They cancel items and never tell you.  How is it possible that I buy pajamas for Christmas and they cancel one on December 23rd and the next one arrives on December 31st, this seems like a joke. 👎👎👎👎"
1593,0,"Target thank you sooo much for not being intimidated by this fake outcry. The Honey Pot commercial is indicative of black women wanting to carry the torch for the next generation of black girls who have not always had the opportunity to excel as entrepreneurs. The commercial is inspirational and will help to broaden Target’s appeal to the next generation of shoppers. If you lose some customers because of the Honey Pot ad, just put some bedding on sale and they’ll come running back."
503,0,The service was really helpful. But the issue shouldn't have happened in the first place...
311,0,"I made a return on December 27 and we are on January 11 and they only returned the money for one item. I made the claim in the store and I have been waiting for more than an hour for them to call the corporation to do something about it, this is a lack of respect in addition to being online for 30 minutes because there is no staff to attend."
39,0,"I ordered a gift card off the wedding registry on June 16. It was ""shipped"" but has yet to arrive. Every other day the arrival date gets pushed back further and further. The wedding and honeymoon have come and gone. Now it's saying delivery date is July 12. I chatted with someone, they told me call someone else and ended the call. It's ridiculous. Never again!"
2468,0,"30 MINUTES ???? That's all you getThat's all you get. Realize you made a mistake or change your mind at 31 mins, to bad.I sent the item to the wrong address. 3 different orders. One was sent to the wrong address.  I was told I have to wait for a tracking number.  Then TRY to get the address changed with the delivery service.  2 tracking numbers were emailed to me.  I'm still waiting for the one I need. It's been two days. It was the first one I ordered. Online customer service says there is nothing they can do.REALLY!  Go into your system change the address! It can be done. REALLY, 30 mins! I called less then one hour after I placed the order! Target needs to remember who is paying their bills.UPDATE.........I received a tracking number Monday evening.I called FEDEX.  They said a change of address needs to be done through the seller. I explained to them that the seller gives a 1-800 # for the delivery service and told me it has to go through the delivery service. Long story short. FEDEX ROCKS!!!!!!!THANK YOU FEDEX, Kimberly and Wilmer. The package will arrive at the right address and on the original date."
2252,0,"Target- McKinney, Texas-  Not only are Target prices higher than just about any place else, they are constantly out of items.  Common sense would tell you if you sell out of something all the time, ORDER MORE OF IT.  How hard is that to figure out?  Hate this store and that's the kindest thing I can say about it.  Check out lines are ridiculous. 5 people deep, only 2 registers open.  Doesn't management see this?  Employees just don't give a crap about anything.  Was out of Tully's Hawaiian coffee K-Cups AGAIN, employee checked to see if any more in the back.  Said they had 4 boxes coming in a few days, like I'm supposed to go home empty handed and then make ANOTHER trip back. 4 boxes?  Cripes, maybe I should camp out in the parking lot waiting for them.  They just don't care about anything, least of all the customer."
2607,0,"The last three orders I placed with target.com had issues.  On one order I ordered jumbo marshmallows & received regular marshmallows.  Of course they were cheaper & when I tried to return them to the store they refused to give me what I paid for the jumbo marshmallows until I requested a manager assistance.  Once the manager completed the transaction he promptly told me that the next time I had an issue with target.com I need to deal directly with them.  Again, I placed another order over $35 dollars but the free shipping did not automatically come up on my order.  It took 45 minutes & three online representatives to credit $5.99 shipping.  Yes, I was not done with target yet.  Sure we all have problems.  I placed another order with target.com 12 days later & I never received my order.  I initiated a chat again with an online representative & they could only refund my money because the items were able to be returned at the store.  What did they not understand I never received my order.  All they offered was order cancelation & I would have to place another order.  Wow, what a waste of time."
390,0,"I ordered liquid sanitizing detergent online. I kept forgetting to pick it up, but I received an email stating my order was picked up. I became concerned, because the only person who could've picked it up was myself. I was livid and immediately went to target on Cobb Pkwy in Smyrna Georgia.  I wish I had gotten this young man's name, because  he has outstanding people skills!!! His customer service is amazing and was through the roof. He's an asset to Target. It's hard to come in for customer service and find people who are willing to assist a customer and be pleasant while doing this. I tip my hat to him."

666,0,"I absolutely wish I could give Target a lower than one star! I tried for hours to log into my account to purchase  items and NO MATTER WHAT I DID it kept saying password wrong and would send new password. However after a rather long wait, when put that new password emailed to me, it said invalid password time and time and time again. Then it said account locked and to ask for a new password which again and again said was not valid when I tried it. I don’t know who manages online sales there but I never had such a frustrating experience with ordering items. I will NEVER EVER try this again and good luck to anyone who does."
783,0,"My experience at Target was very Good 💯 I wanted Cashback because I needed $5 more to send a package by FedEx. I went to Target before I reached the line a Cashier asked if she could help Me? She assisted me and was very helpful , nice, Polite and Professional."
1570,0,"I will not support racism, and Target is just showing its support for racist people."
2451,0,Ordered a gift for someone had a two-day free ship. It has now been 10 and my gift is sitting at a UPS hub in South Carolina and been there for a week. I called last night and was told they will look into it and get back to me in 24 hours. This is the second time they have failed me with shipment dates. Back to Amazon they never fail me!
2344,0,"Horrible customer service at Target in Glendale, AZ 43rd ave and Peoria they are racist and make you wait longer if you are not white. I went there for a exchange of my baby shirts there is a lady named Annie she is very rude and not friendly she also count the shirts to see if they were complete."
2147,0,"Ordered a gift card online last Thursday. Today is Monday, still hasn't shown up so I just requested an immediate credit. I've spent 4 hours in 3 different phone calls, chat sessions trying to get this resolved with no luck. In the day and age of technology, why does it take 24-48 hours to re-issue an electronic gift card??? Sheesh, never again, they are not worth my time. There's plenty of other stores out there."
1904,0,"Sadly, I don't always expect good customer service from large companies like Target, but I was pleasantly surprised when I called their main customer service number. I ended up speaking with three people, all of whom were helpful and kind. The most I had to wait on the line was a couple of minutes, and the last lady I spoke with went above and beyond. I called in to give some feedback regarding an experience I had in my local store, and she did some checking to make sure the situation was completely resolved (which I wasn't even asking for). The slightly negative experience I had in the store was more than made up for by how I was treated by the corporate customer service. They didn't make me feel like my feedback was just going to be ""passed on"" (ie, thrown away), so thank you!"
457,2,Thank yall for sending replacements and giving refunds for missing products
164,0,Andre helped me and deserves kudos!   3 other employees sent me all around the store for shoe laces. Go Andre
431,0,"I love Target. As you enter in the store you feel welcome, the store is well organized. My favorite line is the vegetables, always fresh and beautiful. Another part I like is the home cleaning products which are not expensive, and you get everything there. I recommend Target to everyone of my family and friends. You go there and walk around and your chopping car will be full of different merchandise. Recommended."
293,0,"Target has banned me from ordering online @ Target.com. They stated that it is due to an ""irregularity"" which they are unwilling to clarify due to ""security reasons."" They responded to a Better Business Bureau complaint by stating that ""We apologize for any disappointment, but due to an irregularity with their orders; we’re unable to offer a different resolution.""I am concerned that if left unresolved, their improper handling of this ""irregularity"" may negatively impact me personally, possibly impacting my good standings with other retailers, or maybe even my currently excellent credit score."
172,0,I will not support this devil worshiping store
1248,0,"I really enjoy shopping at Target. They have excellent customer service, superb pricing of their items and selection is just right. I normally purchase just my tights and leggings from Target because of all the styles they have and the pricing of them. Plus the tights and leggings I get from Target meet my beautiful, wonderful, perfect mistress owner Goddess Mia's approval for my female latex vampire slave outfit and they make the perfect accessory for it too. Whenever my beloved mistress owner Goddess Mia is happy, I am so very happy too. Thank you so much Target. :)"
109,0,"I'm boycotting Target for targeting our children with their transgender display of clothing. This is satanic grooming. Target, I don't need you, my children don't need you either."
535,0,"I used to like Target, but today was the final straw when I saw the dog gay pride apparel!! You want to be gay, that's fine, but don't shove it down my throat. Really??? Dog gay pride apparel"
2508,0,They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My experience is so lengthy that I’m not even going to type it up. I will never shop Target online ever again. They clearly do not have a good understanding of what customer service is and based on other reviews I’ve read I’m not alone.
446,0,"If I could rate lower I would.  Ordered phone on 25th said it would arrive on 28th. Didn't leave Target.com til 28th. Been thru PA, OH,IL, MN, ND, MT WA to portland & stuck in Troutdale due to weather.Been told every day would arrive, now it's tomorrow  due to weather, no weather in OREGON. Target unresponsive, specialist hung up on me, 4th person (not supervisor I asked for) ran me around even more. Horrible customer service. Will never order on line from  them again."
739,0,"Returned an item for exchange at the Cedar Park, TX location.  Was given a gift card for my return.  However, at check out the gift card and my exchange (for the same item) didn't add up.  Customer service was no help.  I was told it was correct!  No it was not!!  DO NOT ACCEPT A GIFT CARD ON A RETURN.  IF YOU USE YOUR RED CARD, YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR DISCOUNT!!!!!!"
2378,0,"When making an order it gives you the shipping date so I purchased expedited shipping to get my order before Christmas.  I ONLY did this because items were going to arrive after Christmas and the date changed to plenty of time before with the extra $10. Then two separate times they email me in the middle of the night to say there's a delay.  Like they think I won't see it if they send the email at 2am.  And of course it's the items I paid expedited shipping for.When I went to chat with someone I asked the rep why I'm paying for expedited shipping if I'm not getting it and instead of offering a solution they just went on a long multi message drone about how but if you're going to make people pay for expedited shipping and then delay their order it should be automatically refunded.  And if you can't give a shipping date then give a business day range. They also don't charge until they ship, so my pending charge was correct and then it f*ked up my bank account when the rest of my order didn't ship because they do not notify you of this."
2083,0,I did not like there prices and there r not any tagates left they r really bad
295,0,Ordered from their website and they haven't shipped out yet it's been over 2 days. Other companies ship out like the next day. I email target to see what's going on and they send 1 generic reply and never respond again. Their stores near me are always trashed too. Used to be a good company and nice spot to shop at but their quality of service has gone way downhill. I don't recommend target.
487,0,"I got a gift card and decided to use it for underwear. They sent the wrong size the first time, the second time and the third time they said they won't send me any more. It's THEIR mistake and they were blaming me. I'll NEVER shop at  target again. My opinion is they rate less than 0 stars"
805,0,"Target is a fraud when it comes to gift cards. I bought a gift card from them that stating Target e gift card on May 8th for mothers days. Never got it. once I received a link, my mom went to use it and was told she could not use it at target and can be used only at a restaurant.That is not what she wanted. Long story short they would not honor it as a target card or even refund the money 100$. worst con job ever! It is now June 22 with no resolution."
2297,0,Horrible as far as a employer goes. I work at the horn lake location over two years as a cashier. New management came trained from different stores and quickly became cut throat. I've seen so many cashiers laid off due to gift cards. And excused of stealing but there not trained enough to know what to do in the event some get left behind. If you don't train cashiers what the hell do you expect them to do when they are not trained or tuaght what to do. Ive seen multiple cashiers arrested for this. But you dumb young people hired in from other stores that ain't trained them selves to be any kind of superviser. It's do redicoulus. Once our wonderful Karen retired they hired dumb 20 yrs old since that abuse thier power.  And treat employees horribly. I'm so blessed to have found a wonderful company to work for since. I just feel sorry for the people that are still hanging on there at Target. It will not improve
909,0,Not shopping at Target anymore.  Too much involvment in racial equity/equality..  Most of online ads project black models.  Website is full of black this and black that.  Enough.
778,0,"Tsk, tsk Target. Went to my local Target store to return two cell phones I purchased online.  One box was sealed the other was opened but I was charged a 'restocking fee' of $37.99 PLUS tax on each. Apparently this policy was implemented a few months ago.Some friendly advice to the bigshots at Target...this new, exhorbitant ""restocking"" fee the brain surgeons over in corporate implemented will only serve to alienate what few  customers you have left.  Definitely not a good idea and very bad business policy.  P.S. Your Stanford graduate CEO's may also want to rethink about rewarding millions and millions of dollars to groups that destroyed, looted and committed violence in our cities and stores and cost thousands of people their jobs and livelihoods. Call me crazy - just my humble opinion."
2509,0,"My Target store is  11253 Pines Blvd. Pembroke Pines, FL. It has just been renovated and it is absolutely beautiful. The appearance is more of a Macy’s. While shopping with my daughter I was approached by the staff several times and they helped us find what we needed. The prices are the same as Walmart. I was very impressed."
239,0,"I just had another terrible experience at Target with Drive-Up for groceries. To keep this short, and to the point, I sat in my car for 20 minutes while I watched cars, again, drive up, get their groceries and leave. I finally flagged  down one of the employees outside and asked where is my order and this kid, Matthew, said oh, I’m sorry that was me. I thought another girl had your order, so he signed it off. He thought it was funny because he was smiling and thought it was amusing the whole time he was telling me. I went into the store because the ice cream was like mush, and the manager had the same ridiculous attitude as this kid. I am truly done with Target. There are too many other good stores out there where I don’t encounter these repeated problems."
1244,0,"I barely write any review for anything but I have to say that their gift card service is really bad! So I purchased a gift card for almost a month ago and gave it to my sister as a birthday present. But when she used it for the FRIST TIME which is three days ago that also almost a month from the day I purchased the gift card, it said there was NOTHING in the card, even though they already charged me!! So the registration employee told me to go home and call their gift card service number and I did. Then the agent asked me that I have to have a receipt in order for them to check for me! Then he asked me to go back to local Target to ask for the receipt and I did because I already threw the original receipt away! Like seriously? Who’s gonna keep the receipt from a month ago? Then I went back to ask for receipt. I showed them the bank card that I bought the gift card with and provided them a date and even pointed them the self checkout station I used! But they said “Unfortunately we cannot give you any receipt for this! You have to call back to the gift card service to ask!” Then I had to call back to their gift card service! They asked me to tell “my story” again so they can created me a case so I don’t have to tell them what happened again when another agent speaks to me. Then that agent said I have to call back to them early morning tomorrow because their specialists were not currently available. So I had to call them early morning on the next day! Then when a lady picked up she said she would transfer me to guest relations service for me to ask for the receipt, and then I was on the line waiting for them and they just hung up on me! Then I called back, and there was another agent picked up my call and ask me to tell her my story AGAIN!!! even though I gave her my case number already! So I had to tell different employees there my story for 4 or 5 times! And right now that agent told me their guest service received a large volume of calls so I have to call back at 10am later today! Like seriously? You guys make me think throwing a receipt away from a month ago is MY FAULT??? And you guys made me to go back and forth to that local store wasting my gas and wasting my time for waiting for you guys to answer my question with that guest service??? They should have had any backup way to serve their customers!! Each of the employees kept saying “go to here go to there because we can’t do this without this or that” like really? None of you guys would take that responsibility?? So then who can I ask for help?? I guess that I have to accept the fact that I lost my money for no reason!!! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO TARGET TO PURCHASE ANY GIFT CARD BECAUSE THEIR SERVICE IS REALLY BAD BAD!!!"
1005,0,Target sells crap just like Wal-Mart. Having a Target in your community is a sign that your community is turning to crap.
818,0,"I would not recommend at all baby registry at target. Complicated it to set up, most ppl had a tough time finding it and on top they offer a free gift andits not true. Amazon sent me the free gift home. Target wants you to pick it up at the store and the stores don’t even have the gifts. It’s a waste of time. In addition I ordered a item from my own registry I bought using a gift card and when it arrived home, it was dusty the protective plastic was missing , it was not worthy I had to drive to the store and get me a proper one. Too much hassle when you are pregnant trying to get things ready for the baby!!"
518,0,"Target Age Discrimination Interview Mess Bangor MaineMr, Cornell,During the week of 5/1-5/7 I applied online for a job at the Bangor, Maine Target.  That same week 5/6 I interviewed in person at the store.When I arrived for the interview I was taken to a room in the front of the building.  None of the managers (Amanda, Travis and Brad) in the room knew that I was scheduled to interview that day (Guests Services had scheduled the interview days before).Managers Travis and Brad argued back and forth in front of me about who was going to interview me.  They finally agreed that Travis would conduct the interview.Travis was totally disorganized and uptight during the interview.  He appeared to be going through the motions to get the interview done.  I got the feeling that he disapproved of someone my age and sex applying to be a cashier at Target.During the conversation Travis and I briefly discussed covid 19.  I'm very proud of the fact that I never got covid 19.  I've been very careful during the pandemic and haven't even had a cold or flu for over two years. Travis seemed offended by this and told me he had covid 19 twice. I'm a team player and I communicate well with others.  I have a ton of retail and customer service experience.  I'm college educated and have a fantastic work ethic.  My resume isn't too bad either (attached for you to review).  I'm physically and mentally at the best point in my life.But I'm 61 this week and this tends to be a draw back with corporate America when looking for a job.  I feel that there is a very good chance that I did not get this positions due to my age.  This is an ugly thing to deal with but not uncommon.  Age discrimination is a very common practice in America.  Would you please review this?  I honestly think I've been wronged by Target.  Age discrimination is ugly but I'm finding that it happens all the time with big business.  Youth seems to be all important in all aspects of American life and this includes corporate America. Thank you,Dave Farrar156 Cedar Street Apt#3Bangor, Me. 04401207-904-9963"

But after this foolishness regarding  “female” swimsuits with a penis pouch That a dumbass Target employee decided to publicize, I’m voting against this crap by buying my socks from someone else. Will be buying 6-8 pair of socks this week. Congratulations to Target WOKE"
654,0,I have ordered a few times with the Target online packages either come broken contents broken stuff not wrapped in box very unprofessional I would not buy online from Target if you could help it you're running the risk of having problems one of the worst stores I've seen for deliveries yet
904,0,Had the target redcard terrible card to own cut that thing in half if you have one and cancel it.  They did not send notifications or emails when payment was due to get the extra 29 bucks. This company is ran by noting but sleezeballs. #F-Target
134,0,"I have always loved shopping at Target. I’m an interior designer and huge fan of their home goods (PLEASE Chip and Joanna Gaines sell your merchandise elsewhere). However Targets agenda to PUSH the lifestyle of a small group of people really disappoints me. It’s not the LGBTQ people I’m offended by, it’s Targets narrow scope. It’s disappointing that I have to be wary of my kids picking up a CHILDREN’S book that questions their OWN determination of who they already are. If my daughter questions her gender one day I will address it with grace but stop PUSHING an agenda on our littles, creating questions and confusion that doesn’t need to exist. I read an article about how Target is currently removing “some” of their LGBTQ merchandise from their shelves because of customer backlash. Targets spokesperson said the CUSTOMERS are creating a “volatile” environment for their staff because of comments made to them about their LGBTQ merchandise. In my opinion what’s volatile is the pushing of these products on your LARGEST customer base. *****Most recently Target is calling their disappointed consumers “domestic terrorists”. Your words are strong Target, and so are your satanic t-shirts. VERY disgusted in a store I once loved. If we do not stand for what WE believe in, the values we hold dear will only be a “remember when”. Please help prevent that from happening by boycotting Target. Show other retailers that there are consequences when corporations do not consider their biggest audience. If we don’t NOW, we become small and voiceless. Think of your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren….*****"
807,0,I came to Arlington heights target store in Chicago northwest suburbs. My customer service representative was Amy with another girl (unfortunately I forgot her name). They both helped my son with Xbox earphones. It was a great experience. They were very helpful and did everything what was in their power to help me and my son.
226,0,"for the last 3 days, we are trying to place an order on Target but every time it got canceled when I talk to one of the repenstative  said to create a new account and placed an order when I create a new account and place order the order was again canceled and i told to them and they said we can't do anything"
1893,0,"I bought a jacket as there was whole I went to return it they compelled me to take merchandise return card instead of sending to my card saying I must have US official ID, which I don't as I am new to US. I didn't find any jacket of my size in East Lansing and I can't even order online from Target as it has restriction. I contacted customer care they gave this ref no 66801892. However nothing seems to work. Be careful if you ever plan to return with them.  Really disappointed!"
438,0,"So very disappointed in this company, first time purchasing something online from this company and turned out to be very disappointing. Package didn't arrive and although it may not have been Target fault directly they refused to issue a refund. Customer service was extremely rude when inquiring about a refund as if I was trying to be deceitful . I refuse to let someone take my hard earned money. I demand a refund"
227,0,"The staff at target at Gateway are awful and rude. They lack training in basic CS. This is why I have disdain for this store..ugh!  I went to pick up an item and the lady just walked up to me and said nothing. Just pointed the reader at me.  Huh? I asked her a question about the bag charge and she explained it’s just a hold and blah, blah was her tone. She said she takes the hold off. Since she has the power we are doomed!  Her enthusiasm was zero.I was at self checkout and was told you have to purchase bags first then you can pack your items. The young man was shouting to  make sure we all hear?🙄. 🤢  👎🏿👎🏽. Why? What is all this about?"

461,0,"Issues of Target incompetence:I went to try Target online the other day thinking it was delivery. I went through the entire ordering process, paid only to find it was pick up. If it was there at one point indicating the order was pick up before paying, it sure wasn’t obvious and I wouldn’t have made the order. Then ….. the order was split into 2 stores!!!!!! One 20 miles away from me!!!!!!!!Knowing all this, I wanted to cancel the order. No obvious place online to cancel the order.Went to the Target that is closer to me. She said she cancelled the order, but she did not. Also said, I’d have to go to the other store if I wanted to cancel because she couldn’t cancel from her store. Called the 20 mile away Target and she wouldn’t cancel over the phone, said I could do it on the app. OK, went home, tried to cancel on the app. No place to cancel. I had to call.I called customer service and spoke to a woman who was incompetent and hung up on me.Called back, talked to another person, and she did manage to help me get a “gift card” – no refund on my PayPal account (which by the way, is the practice of hundreds of online shopping businesses) – on only one of the purchases. The other “gift card” said “Here’s your new Target eGiftcard”, a refund from your recent order. I went to where it says you got a Target GiftCard link and I downloaded and all I got was a Target logo.Told this woman that, she put me on hold for 10 minutes, came back and told me that she couldn’t do it, that the “gift card” division would have to deal with it. She transferred me, I was on hold for a half hour. Someone FINALLY answered. I explained blow by blow my nightmare experience with Target, I’m into 2 hours now ….. and he had to put me on hold, he said for 5 or 10 minutes.So he figured it out and said he sent the “gift card”, got the email that says you all are working on it. May take up to 4 hours!!!!!!!!!Unbelievable experience. I have been a Target shopper for 50 years. I may never go back again, and if I wanted something from Target I sure won’t get it online because the system is NOT USER FRIENDLY, is DECEPTIVE, and customer service is incompetent except for the last person who helped me out, after at least 45 minutes including the time he has to put me on hold!"
2495,0,"If you are ordering from Target.com - please do yourself a favor, save yourself from disappointment and bad experience!Some items may seem cheaper on their website than the others but do NOT be persuaded.It was my first time ordering online. I rate shopped from various sites and theirs seems cheaper and faster to get delivered. They do not have an option to expedite shipping, too. They will just give you a range and a faster option is to pick it at the nearest store. I chose the option of picking it up in the nearby store. That saves time a little bit.When I placed my order, I made sure that the last date from the range is still on time for the event that we are going. When we actually need it, to give allowance if there's any delay. Comes the next day, I got an email from them that it will be delayed than the initial range and that they haven't charged my card yet. I thought that's fine, we still have time. So I approved that delay.Come's another day, another email I received from them. Guess what? It will be delayed again!!!! way later than the initial range of date posted when I made an order. The main point why we are placing that order in their website in the first place!So I called their customer support - the person that I spoke to, told me, sorry, the reason for the delay is they thought they have it but turns out they have to get it from another facility hence the delay. He's pinning it on the system they have and they can't do anything about it.VERY MISLEADING!!! Why would their system show that its available and provide a range of date when they can't actually deliver!AGAIN. Do NOT order online on their website else you will be the next person writing another negative review with a bad experience. Try Amazon or something else."

2552,0,"I wen to the store over by my house yesterday to buy a game for my daughter. The store was out of stock and it supposedly was the last of a sale ad. Today I drove 14 miles to a store in Fenton, MO. They had one left. The store Manager's and  (Mc Kenzie) declined my request to get it for the sale price from yesterday. even though the other store was out and I had to drive to the other store to get it. I even google searched the Item and it was still showing the ad price from the day before. I am a retail store manager of 30 years and the company's I have worked for have always matched the ad the day after it ended. to take care of the customer standing there with money in hand. makes no sense. Never shopping at another Target again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

203,0,"I loved Target. It used to be my favorite store to just go in to wander and buy stuff I didn’t need. Well, not anymore. Target used to have the best clothing but they changed so many lines and now I can’t find anything I liked.  Is it me or did Target try to become classy? Why? It totally messed up the store.  I feel like somewhere over the last few years both Target and Kohls went downhill. I find myself liking Walmart so much more. I never thought I would say that.  I used to go to Target weekly, now I go once every few months. Usually when I do go it’s because I want Starbucks.  I just don’t know why anyone would change a good thing. If I wanted a class store I would go to Nordstroms."
1319,0,"I ordered a kitchen table from Target.Com after comparing to other online retailers and basing my decision on good experiences in-store.  This was a huge mistake.  The order was delayed day after day after day and was sitting in the carrier's location for at least a week.  I finally drove to the facility to pick up the package myself (this is over 100lbs).  The package was torn up.  When I got home to unbox it the table was damaged.  I called customer service to file a case and somehow get compensated.  After all I went through, they could not replace the table and only offered a small discount on a table with multiple dents, scratches and holes in it.  Who wants a table that is damaged?  Now it gets better...they have a freight company that is supposed to come to your house for large items in order to get a refund.  The freight company EFW scheduled the pick up for Monday.  No show and no call from them.  I had to contact Target.Com customer service once again.  Luckily, the rep was able to find out what was going on.  Apparently the freight company had no drivers and decided not to contact us after I moved the >100Lb table to my porch as instructed.  The pickup is now pushed out to Friday.  Word to the wise....DO NOT ORDER FURNITURE OR LARGE ITEMS FROM TARGET.COM.  Actually, just stay away from TARGET.COM period."
2377,0,I ordered a bike on target.com dec 6th. They said it would be there the 18th ( which already is way to long) 18th comes and they say it’ll be here by the 22nd. Well no. I spent over an hour complaining and all they can say is sorry here is a 10$ gift card and you’ll just have to wait for it to come. It was a bike for my daughter and now she has nothing to open Christmas morning. I’m beyond mad. Sure I could get a different bike and cancel my order but my kid described to Santa the exact bike and sent in a picture of it with her letter to Santa. She should have to get a different one and 20 days to deliver is ridiculous!!
350,0,"I am an avid Target shopper and I think that will change after my experience today. I consistently by online for Target pick, opt in in lots of their coupon deals and target circle offers and every time they have their offer for receiving  $20, $25, etc. for purchasing a number of qualifying purchase, there is always something wrong with me being able to easily earn my reward. Target is constantly making it difficult for me and I intentionally purchase items to make sure I can get the offer. Tonight was no exception. Called customer service and was given the excuses. I’m tired of supporting a store , spending my hard earned money to fall into this snare constantly. I’m only one, but my consistent orders are not cheap. Target has lost a good customer."

307,0,"What the h kind of ripoff is this??  I order an item online, it says it was delivered -- to a city an hour away from me -- and the online system says I'm refunded, for $1.99 LESS than what I paid because it charged me for shipping, which I got free shipping because I'm a card holder.  Then the ""chat"" system comes up with a guy to help, but it's literally impossible to type into the screen.  There's no other way to contact them except call during the workday when I'm, uhh, working!! and not taking a break to call about an $11 Target just ripped me off on.  Target has sunk to the level of the big W, just as bad."
96,0,"As a lay consumer at Target.com, I have no reason whatsoever to know of what ""Shipt"" is. When I place an order for ""same-day delivery"" and pay the $9.99 fee, I don't care what apparatus Target uses to tender the delivery to me. Whether you use Shipt, Roadie, DoorDash, or Aunt Franky on her road bike, it doesn't matter to me as a customer. All I know is that it cost $9.99 and I just add tip for the kind human who made the effort.So. When I have a problem with an item or the delivery itself (ANY aspect of the delivery), I should be able to call Target.com and not have the customer service representative claim it's not Target's fault, but rather, it's ""Shipt"" who is the responsible party. Do you expect a lay consumer to open up some boilerplate and sit there and read through what the contours of Target and Shipt's relationship are? Lol, what?I ordered it on TARGET.COM. I transacted business on TARGET.COM. The item was sold by TARGET.COM. I gave my credit card information on TARGET.COM. The order confirmation, completion, and receipts are all from or on TARGET.COM. As a customer, I should be able to call Target.com with an order-related issue and not be told that someone else is responsible. I am not a savvy professional like you guys are. I am just some lady sitting on her couch. How the heck should I know what Shipt is if I ordered it on Target. YOU are ultimately responsible for the order. If there is some internal confusion about which internal entity or partner handles customer support in specific situations, you need to hash that out behind the scenes and not have your own confusion spill out in a REAL customer service context."

I waited at the Order Pickup counter for 20  minutes while 5 employees worked on 3 registers at the Returns Counter helping out customers that got there well after I got to the Pickup Counter. Not one employee said a word to me. After being ignored for that long I cancelled the order on the Target App and left. This is not the first time I have had or seen issues at this Target.

2187,0,"Beware of purchasing a smart phone from a Target store in case you have an experience similar to mine. I purchased a new phone and despite declining the insurance program (Square Trade, an Allstate Company, which charges you 10.99 a month to ""protect"" your phone after a $129 deductible per claim), I was told I could not purchase the phone without the Square Trade policy. But I was assured I could easily call and cancel it. I tried to cancel it two days after purchase by calling the number listed on the brochure (1-877-927-7268). I was lead through prompts (#3 = all other calls, #3 to cancel) but each time I tried to cancel, I was told, ""Sorry, I didn't get that."" After 3 attempts, the line disconnects with a, ""Please try your call again later."" I tried my call three times. Finally, I called and used the prompts to get a sales agent, who said she she would cancel the policy for me. I have yet to receive the confirmation email she promised."

We flagged down an employee  To help, and she told us that the prices on the rack were incorrect, and there was nothing they could do. We would just have to eat the $3 difference, and she didn't  bother to get her manager to help. We went to customer service, and Aida gave us the prices that were indicated on the rack. She saved the experience for us, because I would have put back the merchandise and left on principle alone. Other than this debacle, the experience was excellent."
564,0,"Target.com is a failed business. They are not in any way posed to compete against other online providers like Amazon or Walmart. Their system has no even a cancel order button. If you order something online and changed your mind in a minute (before shipped, to be clear here) you will have to wait until it gets delivered. If you call customer service they also don’t have the ability to cancel. You have to wait until it gets delivered and take it back to their store. They have a lot to do to compete in the todays market."
1161,0,"Normally like Target. However, recently ordered some towels and air freshners. They were all placed in one box but the air freshners were not protected to prevent spraying.  I lost almost half the bottles by this. The box was soaked. USPS is always horrible: the box was broken, busted, and tape ripped. So I was extremely disappointed to see that Target did not have a piece of bubble around the 10 bottles of air freshner to prevent the spraying. I paid for 10 but only received usedable product of 6."

You do not need to push sexuality onto our children or having them wear little sleazy dresses. Let our children be little and stop pushing your agenda!"
2489,0,"I'm giving target a one star due to the company false advertising items. The ads say one thing but when you get in the store it's something different. This week they advertised if you purchased a frozen turkey with coupon the pricing is $.59 per pound. Sizes from 10 to 24 pounds,  so when I went in the store on Monday  all the turkeys were under 20 pounds. The lady in the department said she will order some and they will be in on Friday. I go in on Friday and they still didn't have any over 20 pounds so what was the point of advertising that if the store wasn't going to get in all different pounds of the turkey. Definitely won't shop at target any more."
1595,0,"If Target had a commercial of a brand a white lady owned and said the exact same thing, all hell would break loose!Why does it have to be "" for the next BLACK girl that comes up with a great idea – she can have a better opportunity"" and not for ALL races?

744,0,"Dear Target, I used to absolutely love shopping at your NW Rochester, MN location. Then corporate decided to ""upgrade"" the store. I was happy to see that you were getting a facelift. I even was patient with the process. But then when it was finished, I discovered that corporate decided that the beauty supply area needed to look like a boutique. Everything is separated by manufacture instead of heres the shampoos, here's the face creams, here's the lotions. What should have taken 15 minutes of shopping took over an hour because I spun in circles trying to find things. It's very frustrating.So instead of perusing the rest of the store to find fun things to buy, I had to get essentials and get out. (Which I ended up skipping half of that list too.)I despise Walmart, Shopko and Kmart are both gone. So I guess I may be doing more of my shopping at Dollar General, or Walgreens. At least I have grocery options elsewhere."

469,0,"Hear my warning, do not I repeat, do not apply, work, or have anything to do with Target, and this corporation. My manager Ryan at the Chambersburg Warehouse has clearly messed up my career life. He and the entire corporation mentally messed up with be by putting me in trouble for no reason. My depression and self harm had worsen because they kept threatening me with ""correct of action"" and ""termination"". I also got in trouble from them for a doctor's note due to back injuries I got from them. The worst part is, I can't get a decent job anymore because of being blacklisted from them. Overall, Target does not care for their workers. They'll work you till your back gives up, then, they'll fire you and blacklist you. Again, do not work for Target at all. Their pay rate is just a bait for a world full of hurt."
1568,0,"I have to say I'm shocked you would support a product such as Honeypot and air a racist commercial, I was interested in the product until I seen the commercial, the comment about young black women was racist it should have just been young women/girls but she played the race card...I use to love shopping at Target, won't be anymore, how can you support racism."

They are saying ups pick the same day 155 pounds and in two hours they send me back the same package. How the heck it can be happened like that. Shame on you. I know companies sometimes get greedy, but not that much."
1831,0,"So Target has a brand new product called ”Honey Pot” that they are  carrying and I’m sure the product is very good!  Here’s the problem, the lady that invented it “Beatrice Dixon” says (on the Target commercial on TV), that she’s very proud of it (which I’m sure she is) and she hopes that she has helped and/or inspired the next “black girl” to be able to do the same as her! What? Why does it have to be a “black girl” how about just a girl or women? In a time where we should not be playing any kind of race card to profit as a huge conglomerate business or an individual, Shame on Target and anyone or business that is so money hungry that they encourage this racist mentality in today’s world. Target should remove the “Honey Pot Company” commercial and refilm it with the verbiage and intent for all people to be inspired to create a business such as “Honey Pot Company” and have the owner “Beatrice Dixon” include in her commercial that she hopes to inspire anyone of any race to create a business, that she hopefully inspired them to do so!

935,2,"The Target staff had difficulty processing my order and basically couldn’t find $130 worth of products that I paid for but didn’t receive. I then had to wait an hour and a half for the first manager to figure it out. She resolved some of the issues, but not all of it. Then the second manager was called and was also on break and din’t come out for another hour. I was in line for  over three hours and they still didn’t resolve everything. Later, I was making returns and retelling the earlier events to my friend on the phone. I was getting angry and raising my phone. I attracted the attention of the two security staff. They started to tell me to calm down and say that I was disturbing the peace and acting irrationally. I told them to back off and leave me alone and that I’m just talking to my friend and that they need to leave me alone or I’m going to get even more loud and upset.  They continued to tell me to simmer down, and then the called the cops on me. The cops manhandled me to the ground by the self-checkout and handcuffed me, and I still have bruises on my leg from the incident that happened over a week ago. I am a 115lb affluent stay at home mom who has never had an altercation with law enforcement before. And, I blame Target and their staff for being so incompetent and holding me hostage there for almost 10 hours without so much as offering me a bottle of water or a banana so I wouldn’t faint. It was a horrific experience, and I will never step foot in another Target again. And I hope you reconsider as well. As far as I can tell, nobody there is being punished for their role in what happened to me."

399,0,I live in Naples and was out of town visiting family when my item from Target was delivered. I planned out exchanging the color when I got back to Naples. The color I wanted was out of stock. We were in Ga. when we learned of the hurricane so we stayed. We live 1 Mike firm the beach and our neighbors homes were destroyed. Once I got back to Naples I tried to exchange my item and was told I was a few days too late to exchange. I could not drive back during the hurricane to make the deadline. They refuse to do anything. This has to be the worse customer service I’ve seen. I will never shop from there and hoping my neighbors take that into consideration when thinking of shopping there. So many companies helping us out here and Target does this. Shame on them!!!

What they should really advertise is buy two packs of diapers and a $15 gift card that we will charge you for but tell you it’s free. They will not give you a free $15 gift card. My purchase from target was $93.40. They charged me three separate transactions, the first one for $78.40 then later charged me two different transaction one for $15 and another for $15.90. Basically, I paid for my own gift card. This is really upsetting as it is false advertisement and they will not give you a refund as they say that they have to charge somewhere for the gift card.

1280,0,"Good B&M retailer failing at e-CommerceMY criticism is based on the incredibly poor methods Target has used to manage online stock and deterring resellers using robotic shopping bot. Plain and simple this retailer DOES NOT CARE. Apparently they do not care if their products are sold to customers or robotic resellers. Limits are ineffective or non-exsistant. No IP sniffing, Captcha verification, or account limits. AS long as Target get paid they can care less if CONSUMERS actually are buying the product. The stock notification system is laughably delayed. I would rather they stop selling certain products since they only seem to serve as a source for resellers. Of nationwide online retailers, they easily offer the worst overall experience. It pains me to say this but Wal-mart's archaic online platform offers a better experience. Now it appears they have started screening negative product reviews. Anything remotely negative is NOT posted on product page. This is especially the case when there are already some negative reviews. I only deal with their site because I have to, and I do hope they STOP carrying what I need so that ANY other vendor can attempt to step in and do a better job... What happened to caring about customer experience? I guess if a few resellers with bots are happy while alienating the bulk of end-use customers that is an acceptable trade-off."

Target's answer is to pack up all 30ish pieces ship it back and wait for another one. So take up more of my time. I was offered a 20% discount. I had to make several phone calls to both target and FedEx about two hours of my time. I am supposed to be willing to invest more of my time to pack things up to return it wait for a second one unpack that one again my TIME IS WORTH MORE THEN 20% OF A 271 DOLLAR ITEM. 54 dollar which is about 20% is about what i make for an hour and a half of work."

We still received anticipated delivery dates that kept being extended but when we still hadn't receive our order by July 1 we called and learned it hadn't even shipped yet. We cancelled the order but then only received a partial refund and had to call again. 4 calls and 1 chat later it appears we will finally get the full refund.

Call wait time is over an hour. Email support states because of high demand they cannot help. Target customer support sucks. Buy from Amazon. At least they’ll reply and give you $5 credit if they screw up."

2233,0,"AWFUL is all I can say.  I placed an order on a Thursday & Target's website noted an expected delivery on Monday.  Great!  Monday came - nothing.  Tuesday came - nothing. By Wednesday, I called Target.com to find out the status of my order.  Representative ""Fred"" said UPS is putting a tracker on the order so there is probably a shipping problem.  He then proactively placed a free replacement order with express shipping so I can receive the replacement order by the Thursday or Friday.  Great customer service, I thought.  On Thursday, the order status of the replacement order is ""Preparing to Ship"".  What???  Shouldn't the replacement order already be shipped as the expected delivery day is Thursday or Friday???  After some more digging on Target.com website, it turns out they do not ship out any replacements until the original products are returned.  This workflow makes sense for a normal order where a customer opts to replace a defective or wrong product but it does not make sense for my situation!  I do NOT have the original products since they are still lost somewhere in the UPS system so how can I return these original products to Target to activate the replacement order???  Talk about chicken and the egg problem!  I called Target.com again to explain the paradox and ""Ashley"", without listening to my full explanation quickly canceled the replacement order.  What???  I am now back to square one with the original order that may or may not be lost in the UPS system and NO replacements.  I asked her to transfer me to her supervisor since she obviously doesn't understand the issue because she cannot explain to me what are the problems.  She put me on hold and after waiting on hold for 20 min., I just gave up.  I have now spent almost an hour on dealing with Target.com without any satisfactory resolution!  I will wait another week (it would be 2 weeks since my original order) to see whether UPS will deliver my original order.  If not, I will dispute the charge with my credit card company since I never received my order.  It is a shame that a large company like Target cannot resolve a fulfillment issue that is clearly not the fault of the customer.  Never again."
2203,2,Fell outside of Target on sidewalk full of thick ice.  Bad & permanent injuries.  Can't use 1 leg at all.  BIG run a round from Target. Target is saying:  we know you fell and injured yourself but we're not liable even though we didn't shovel or salt.
1113,0,"I think it's time to boycott Target. This store has gotten to be one of the worst stores there is, as far as price gouging and purposely keeping items off the shelf (forcing you buy the undesired cleaning items) during this pandemic. At this point, I'd rather drive across town for what I need than put up with this price gouging game they are playing. $4.29 for a gallon of bleach, caked in dust! This is ridiculous! There is NO WAY anyone can say that this store has been understanding or caring about their customers during a time like this. Greed is definitely their only goal. I'll be shopping at any store other than Target from now on!"

I went to to the store a few days later to pick it up only to find out that they apparently “ had issued a refund “ which I still haven’t gotten my money back! Now the toy is about $40 more expensive and they will not price match it even tho I had already purchased it! And I’m pretty sure they returned it because now the toy is selling for more money and they are trying to make more profit out of . I am so infuriated and disappointed not to mention that I don’t have a present  or my money that i payed for this toy for my daughter. all thanks such neglectful and careless company that does not care about they’re customers. And they they offer me 15% off like that’s such a huge accommodation that doesn’t even take care of how much more the toy cost now. All I WAT IS WHAT I PAID FOR INITIALLY!!this is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a retailer!!!  I never thought that a company so big and famous would have such horrible service. This was the first and last time I will ever shop with target.com or at a target store! I NEED MY MONEY REFUNDED ASAP!!! OR SEND ME WHAT I PAYED FOR!!!! I my self am a manager at a high end store at the mall and I provide customer service every day not only to locals but also international customer. Rest assure I will let all my friends and family know about my experience and to avoid shopping with your store.

I even called the morning of to make sure item was there before I drove down and was told it would be there when I came in. Lies!!! Nowhere to be found after a 30 minute search and a complete waste of gas and time. Moving on...  I got the refund and it was 1/2 what it should have been called customer service and sat in hold for 1 hour and 45 minutes and they said there was nothing they could do. I lost half my money and also the gift card used to pay for the dress. I will never shop at target again. They have gone completely downhill.  Too bad they are so horrible compared to several years ago when they prided themselves on guest service.  Boo Target!"

Never ever will I shop at a target store nor online or in store!!! Worst experience ever!!!

Unbelievable way to treat a long time good customer.  I will be doing my Christmas shopping elsewhere.

I spent >30 min on hold to be told that order couldn't be cancelled and would be shipped ""soon"" but no estimate on when ""soon"" would be. It was set to arrive >2 weeks after the original estimate with no clear reason and no ability to cancel.

It actually took three days and the delivery date changed after I purchased the item. I don't appreciate the dishonesty. Just be upfront and tell me exactly how long the shipping will take.

Tried to take it back to the store that I purchased from and they said no you need to get something from electronics for the same amount!! what could I possibly need from electronics nothing and even if I did at this point I wouldn’t purchase electronics from Target any more!! So they said call corporate they will help, I called corporate explained the issue the the guy says I need to transfer you to someone higher than me. Cool 😎 but homie did a cold transfer and I had to explain myself all over and give the information I had already given all over again 😡😡 so 2nd person helping me places me on hold to speak w/ the manager and comes back w/ “I’m sorry, but there is nothing that we can do to help you” we can only do an even exchange.

He ""threatened"" to call the police and I said please do. Empowered by the employee's harassment of me, several customers verbally attacked me. This triggered a severe panic attack (I'm a DV victim, hence the exemption), and I blacked out. I was able to rouse myself (no thanks to the employees or customers!), and requested an ambulance. 45 minutes of me having this attack, no police or EMT arrived.

The store near me - in Gaithersburg, Maryland - has filthy restrooms, doesn't keep shelves stocked and WORST OF ALL posts sale prices on the product shelves but conveniently forgets to change the scanned price.  Honestly every time I've shopped at Target over the past six months I might have been ripped off - if I had not closely watched how products were ringing up!  I spent the time, wrote my comment on YOUR portal more than a month ago.  And NEVER RECEIVED AS MUCH AS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  So I am going public."

On that day I went to receive the furniture and they told me it would take another week to arrive. The person I was talking to quickly diverted blame by saying 'you ordered on x so it will be here on y'. I had to point out to them that no, I have a document from you which says otherwise. This defensiveness is not only unprofessional but extremely irritating. If the eta stipulated on the receipt is incorrect why not send a message to let the customer know? Why put it there in the first place? Why act like a ponce and divert blame? I would be a lot less frustrated if the customer service person said 'ahh yes, this seems to be our fault - I'm sorry for the delay but it will be here on x'. Such a needlessly frustrating experience where the company refuses to admit that the goods I ordered are late!"

I literally placed my order the same day, in fact within an hour of the items appearing on the Target website.  In May Target shows my order as back-ordered.  Huh?  But ok.  In June they send email for me to approve a delay.  Huh?  But ok, I click ""approve"" and the delivery date extends to July 15th.  THEN AT ON THE MORNING OF JULY 15TH I NOTICE AN EMAIL FROM 5AM -- YES 5AM -- STATING MY ORDER WAS CANCELLED.  WHAT?!?!  It stated the cancellation was since I didn't respond to an earlier delay-approval email.  So I checked -- turns out that earlier email was sent to me at 4AM!  I'm sorry Target I WAS ASLEEP AT 4AM!!!  Of course the items are no longer available on Target website and won't be again.  A Target Online manager tells me the cancellation was due to inventory shortages -- which was a load of crock AS I TURNED AROUND AND ORDERED THE VERY SAME ITEMS from another company... a company with decency... that won't send trap emails at 4AM to justify bogus cancellations born of their poor online retail model.  What happened to me just confirms that Target works with scalpers and is an underhanded, unethical, shady company.  Who treats customers this way?  You either say pre-sales are sold out or you honor your order.  I'm going to the BBB with this one.  These kind of shady business practices need to be noted and monitored."

Absolutely a joke and especially when no communication from this company that has gone downhill. Oh and contacting customer service just time I can't get back
2496,0,"Did not get complete order, no communication that complete order was not coming, very hard to cancel remaining order. Paid with Pay Pal very hard to get a refund in a reasonable time frame.Do Not recommend Target for online orders"
1257,0,"I love Target and prefer it to Amazon.  I hate shopping so I have most of the things I buy delivered. Target delivers, has curbside pick up and a very good return policy.  I like returning something and not having to  wait for the email saying the company received it. Target doesn't have the variety of Amazon but the products are purchased from a Target store so I'm confident they're clean / unopened, etc.  (I've bought things thru Amazon that were clearly -- CLEARLY -- used.) So anyway I like them.  Their sales are good. Their employees, I believe, aren't paid slave wages like Amazon.  I think they get healthcare, too.  So I support that with my dollars."
433,0,"The Target nearest me  all in all is a good store except if you want to look for clothing! It's not shoppable! Parts of womens clothing looks like a black Friday had taken place! Just a hot mess. I've been in retail a good part of my life and clothing being one area. You have to make it look presentable, Inviting, catch your eye not walk by and say ""what in the world has happened here?"" I should have taken pics but didn't. I was embarrassed for them."
415,0,Target is the worst. They cancelled my order bc i took “too long to pick it up” and the never refunded me. Apparently if you use paypal you get a gift card code which no one tells you (never do this!!) i have called and been transferred and talked to 6 different people all of who apparently fixed my issue and never got anything from them. I just want my 20 dollars back i recommend never shopping target online. Never call their helpline. One person in particular barely spoke english and was the rudest person i have ever spoken with. There were a few who were nice but no one could actually get me ny refund. I think its a scam. Forget target. Shop amazon
2202,0,"Target 2 day shipping is a scam. Ordered just a couple of shirts on a Monday. They did not arrive until the following weeks Wednesday. That’s 9 days. It even took longer than 2 days after the items were shipped, meaning they could have shipped it two day but chose to ship it slower. It is a total scam and they admit it when you press them on it. The wording on the site is only a suggested arrival. No other company does this."
554,0,"I get my best clothes and jewelry here, without all the fuss of having to drive for an hour, i'm just saying it's nice, easy and local. My kids are always asking to go get a toy or a new  t shirt because the lines are so short."
2578,0,Worst experience ever and will never shop with target again. Went to buy a PlayStation plus for online games and as at checkout was told I couldn’t use my Westfield gift cards to buy another card. Then discover the same PS4 plus for $15 less at Eb games and tried to return said gift card  (hadn’t left shops yet on same day and hadn’t activated card) and informed cannot get refund as it’s a gift card. ( not explained at check out). Lost a customer who will permanently go elsewhere from now on.
2138,0,I bought a bathing suit online and the next day my credit card got hacked. Will not but from target again.
1548,0,"Target cancelled my order after 5 days.  So, they had my order for 5 days saying it was being processed. Then I get two emails saying some of my order, which was basically the two items I ordered had been cancelled.  Way to go with customer service Target.  If you can't fulfill the order you shouldn't advertise that it is for sale and available.   Never happened to me on Amazon."
2380,0,"I purchased a gift for my son from Target on December 19th with guaranteed delivery by December 24th.   Here we are December 22nd and the delivery date is December 27th??   What a joke.  Customer service offered me a 15% discount for the trouble.  That is no help whatsoever, I would much rather have the gift delivered to me when promised.   Going to Best Buy to purchase this gift now and will be returning the Target gift when it arrives - after Christmas. Never again Target!!"
249,0,Actually it's 0 stars but that option is not available.  Target online customer service is deplorable!!  Out of Country customer service people that have 0 clue about providing any form of customer service.  I sent an item back over a week ago with the label target sent to me via email.  I have the tracking from UPS but Target states they cannot yet locate it!@#$%^&*()_. SERIOUSLY!!!!!.  TIME TO CALL MY BANK AND DISPUTE THE CHARGE!!!!!!
2239,0,"I TRIED to pay for an item to be shipped for me to pick up at my local Target-Mini 400 grand st nyc 10002.  I was told it couldn't be delivered. I am PREPAYING $9.99 FOR THE sale ITEM, (ALL 141OZ DETERGENT) AND THEY CAN'T DELIVER IT TO THE STORE FOR ME TO PICK UP. BJS store has double ounce jug for $15.00"
142,0,"I am a wife and a mother of a six-year-old little boy. After seeing the lgbtq display geared towards babies and children, I will never spend another penny in this establishment. My husband also will not because we do not agree with this message. Why can't kids just be kids? Do you really think children care about gender this, non binary that? Do you think a little boy would really want to tuck his penis between his legs, to make it look more like a vagina? No little boy would do this unless he was being taught to or groomed to. I think it is sickening that Target is supporting and promoting this by selling these products. I also am opposed to Target selling designs by a Satanist. That person seems very angry. In checking out her website, it seems to me that she hates straight people.  Does Target not do research about designers before they commission them? Maybe Target stands behind devil worship. I guess that would explain why they are trying to indoctrinate our children with all the lgbtq geared towards kids. If you shove that stuff in their face all the time, I think there will be a chance that they will want to do it. Children emulate us. They are very malleable at their young age. I am greatly disappointed. I am currently in the process of telling all of my family members about the lgbtq line in hopes they will no longer shop at Target. My mom agrees with me and she already said she won't go back. Many more relatives to go. I think when a company targets kids' people like me will stand together to fight it for the sake of our children."
946,0,"I felt like I was at Walmart today. Not enough registers open, seven people in line and maybe three registers even open. Would rather shop at Walmart to experience this kind of customer service with lower prices.   We spend $350 a couple of times a month and will be taking my money elsewhere."
1334,0,"Target has been a part of my family of stores since its inception into Southern California BUT, you can be rest assured all future purchases will be directed to other than a company who supports a MARXIST organization such as Black Lives Matter."
1806,0,I am not a regular Target shopper but have gone there here and there and always leave aggravated.  Today I drove out of my way to get an item that stated it was IN STOCK and a clearance item. I thought wow that's a great price so I went and of course I was disappointed again.  Couldn't find item anywhere.  Asked an associate for help and he also couldn't find item. He told me that target doesn't really keep on track of clearance items.  Maybe they conveniently leave clearance items listed as in stock to get people in there.  Iv had it. Won't be going to target anymore
1379,0,"I am only giving 1 star because the cashier was nice. if you are going to keep the yellow stickers that are below the product showing 50% and the other 33% off for the Oil of Olay sticks, I highly suggest you honor that price I brought it to the cashiers attention that they are ringing up full price and what the yellow stickers say, the cashier calls some guy over to use whatever it is to check the prices informs me they are full price, I try to explain to this ass about the stickers he makes it very clear he does not care. I told him that the stickers need to be removed and he just walks off. I really hope this ass is not in charge any way shape or form. He should not be in charge of the trash removal for that matter.I do not care what is going on you do not treat customers like this !!!"
29,0,I like Target but their bag fees are ridiculous. They put 1 small item in a bag resulting in way too many bags at pick up. They need to think about how many item (s) are going into a bag and be considerate of their customers picking up their purchases.
37,0,"Stop with the LGBT rainbow agenda, especially for children! Stop! So sick of companies sexulizing our kids! I don't care what people do, that's their business, but you are shoving this down our throats, people are sick of this! Let kids be kids, not our politics! Target has lost my business!"
2615,0,"I love Target and ordered several times until they decided to stop shipping to the country where I live. That was really a shame, would have ordered much more if I just could!"
859,0,"Entered a Target in a no mask mandate state, and was accosted immediately by a girl at the front desk who yelled loud enough for the customers in the back of the store to hear her that I had to wear a mask in the store.  Unlawful and a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Plus, she was just plain stupid for trying to make a scene with her obnoxious yelling."
703,0,"Really disappointed.I got my orders cancelled as well.Just was talking with support, and they told me that I can go to the Target and buy everything there. But online and pick up are disabled for me! And they can not provide me a reason for that!Sure, I know that I can go to the market and buy everything there. But there is a reason why target.com exists! To make orders online!!!I was loyal Target customer, but this is unacceptable!!!!Congratulations Target, you push your payable customers to Amazon…"
1508,0,"Let me preface by saying I was a huge Target fan. So much so that I bought a $100 digital  gift card for myself in December of 2019 because I knew I’d easily spend it within the following months. Fast forward to March 25, 2020 when I received a notification on my phone from the Target app that a purchase had been made in store... with my digital gift card... in Illinois. I’m from Texas, live in Texas, and have not left left the state of Texas in months, and have not even left my home in weeks due to social distancing. I don’t even know anyone who lives in Illinois let alone Hodgkins, IL. I immediately call the target customer service number and wait to speak to a representative in the gift card department.  After explaining my situation she apologizes and tries to transfer me to their “Gift Card Specialist” only to realize its after 8PM and they’re only working 7am-8pm hours. She closes off the gift card with a remaining $4 balance and it’s removed from my account. She gives me a reference number and asks me to call in the morning. I change my password that night. Next morning I call and I’m again transferred twice. Once I get to speak to this specialist she apologizes, and tells me she will bring it to leadership to investigate. I wait one week for an email response before I send an email to their “abuse” email listed on their website. I get a response that day that reads: Thanks for your patience while we reviewed your Target GiftCard. After further research, we're not able to confirm any suspicious activity on your gift card. Because of this, we're unable to replace your gift card. As a next step, we encourage you to file a police report and Target will work directly with law enforcement. We sincerely apologize and hope you'll visit us again. We appreciate your understanding.EXCEPT THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING. I don’t understand how they can not confirm suspicious activity. So I file a police report in Texas. And the police department asks me to file one in Hodgkins as well. So I call the Hodgkins PD and the officer is unsure of how to proceed considering I live in Texas. He calls Target with my reference number and he’s told the case is closed and not up for further investigation from their side. He calls me back and apologizes (even though he doesn’t need to because it’s out of his power - because it’s Target’s responsibility to protect customer data) because I’m essentially out $100. So how is it my fault that Target’s database was breached? How can they not look into it? NEVER PLAN ON BUYING A TARGET GIFT CARD OR KEEPING ANY INFORMATION WITH TARGET."
1452,0,I have bought three Conair blow dryers from Target and all three had electrical issues.  The first two popped and burned out. The most recent one shot flames out. I threw it to the ground and it shot out more flames. It caught the carpet on fire. I grabbed the damn thing and patted the fire out.  Target needs to be made aware of the extensive fire hazard the se Conair items have. I didn't realize the extent of the problem until I researched Conair reviews.  One woman was electrocuted and had sustained permanent problems with her arm and another woman sustained injury to her eye. Over there I think that Target has an obligation and a liability to its customers and should look further into this issue.  I have been a loyal target customer for over 25 years.  I cannot think that Target would turn its back on its customers over preference of a product.
575,0,"Target is a very racist establishment. I’m 58 with a credit score of 640, not the best certainly not the worst. Since I was 22 I’ve tried for a credit card and all these years I’ve been denied. I work as an LPN for 25 years and I’ve taken white patients of mine to target,they applied and got a card right on the spot and told me their score was worse than mine. I am African American. Today I was accepted for a discover yes it’s just 1000 credit amount as well as I have kohl’s and Pennys and a capital one card but dang Target is one of the hardest to get IF you’re black so Target you can kiss my you know what and keep your 7 day letter and I will not shop in there ever again"

1518,0,Ordered a dress but selected wrong size. Asked to change size but told it had been posted and they would only give a discount and no exchange. When the dress arrived I emailed again and even though I offered to pay all postage they refused to change the size. Money grabbers with no customer service.  Dress cheaply made too with bits of thread left hanging.Plenty of other companies around.
2022,0,"Don’t order photos at Target!!! I order 120 photos online, got e-mail saying the photo was processing, and my take about 24 hours, I wait the 24 hours went there to get my photos and they don’t process photos, I have a huge deadline and now I have to find another place to print, pay more expensive to print them! Very upset with Target"
23,0,Twice target has cancelled my order for absolutely no reason. I called customer service and couldn't even understand a word the agent was saying. If you are going to answer calls on a customer service line they should at least have somebody that can speak English CLEARLY! This is a very shady tactic. They take the order put a pending charge on my bank account and then now tell me the order was cancelled. They have done this every time I have tried to make a purchase from them I WILL NEVER SHOP AT TARGET AGAIN. THE ONLINE STORE IS A SCAM. REPORTING THEM TO THE FAIR TRADE COMMISSION.
2099,0,"Placed a order with Target. The shipping carrier they used returned my item way before the 15 day pickup window. Called Target after being on hold for 20 minutes and got them to locate where my item was because at the time I didn't know it had been sent back. Got a email saying my item had been returned to sender and that they cannot ship the item back to me. Responded to the email and recieved a $20 egiftcard for the inconvenience that I can't even use because I live in Canada. So yet again wasted my time calling again just to he told they cannot do anything and I have to place the order again. Well now the website doesn't even work!! All I want is my item sent to me that I paid for because it is exclusive to you!!! This is the worst customer service ever! Now I have to wait 24-48 hours for someone else to call me, probably to tell me again that nothing can be done. It's your companies error and you should own up to it. I wasted MY time and gas. You guys should be giving me a full refund and shipping the item back to me for free! Horrible Company. Not only have you lost my business but a friend that didn't even know you shipped to Canada has now decided against placing his order to you guys since I told him what happened."
251,0,"I came to purchase a mattress pad, having found the one I wanted in under 4 minutes.  This *should* be a simple task, as with other purchases: click to add the item to my cart, click to check out, enter my shipping and payment information, and get on with my day.43 minutes later, I finally had my order filed and my information supposedly secured.  The site won't let me order without creating an account.  Target has an ""opt out"" policy for selling my contact information, and the process to opt out is both hidden and broken.  I had to call customer support to complete my order, because the ""check out"" sequence hangs before I can enter my shipping info.The customer support rep had barely enough English to complete my order, and I had to speak slowly to accommodate her lack of typing skills.  When we got to the ""opt out"" sequence, she didn't understand the phrase ""opt out"", nor the concept of selling my information.  I asked to transfer to someone with enough English.  She may have tried to do so, but the call dropped soon thereafter.I did complete the opt out process via my second attempt at chatting with an on-line representative.I won't come back here; my time has value, and the cost of this mattress pad is now comparable to the price of an imported piece at the fancy continental place downtown."

1463,0,"Ordered 10 Tiegen plates online from Target as a gift to our son stuck in DC during the pandemic. They arrived like a joke - 10 shattered plates with no packing whatsoever. We ordered 6 for ourselves in Napa. Two were shattered - ours were also packed like a joke - no bubble wrap, just flying loose in the box. Reviews are being policed on the website - no way to warn others. After allowing one from another person that warns the packing is negligent, try as we might, new ratings/comments aren't being allowed or put up. Our local Target is next to our grocery store. We've been spending oodles of money in the store becuase it's convenient, but after this shocking experience, will not walk in anymore. This is beyond negligent customer service and shipping. The customer service person I called last night told us Target is aware with the plate/shipping issue. They obviously just don't care."

AND THEN THIS PERSON MUMBLE SOMETHING AND THEN HUNG UP.  I WILL NEVER VISIT OR ORDER ANYTHING AT TARGET AGAIN.  THESE CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ARE LOOSING YOU BUSINESS, AND I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS BEEN DONE THIS WAY.  TARGET YOU PROBABLY NEED TO START LISTENING TO THESE CALLS!"
1384,0,"I founds a reasonable deal on an Ipad at Target.com.  I was willing to pay a 50$ premium to have it a week sooner than I could get it from Apple.  It got shipped to the wrong address.  I saw this immediately and called them.  They said it was too late, they could not change it.   OK.  They then said call back next Thursday when it is going to be delivered and we will reach out to the UPS driver directly.  For some reason, they needed me to call back and remind them of this, as if the situation might magically change while it was being shipped.  I checked the tracking number on Thursday morning and it said it was going to be delivered on Friday.  Later I get another email that it is out for delivery today.  I call immediately. I am on the phone for 26 minutes and I am told that it has been delivered.  I go to the address (my old house), the people there refused it.  2 Hours of my life on the phone... gone.... never get it back.  They are now sold out of it, so I won't even get it later.  Terrible logistics and customer service.  Fooey!!!"

1076,0,"Target is the worst in customer service. I bought a product online to store pick up. Target emails me your Order is ready  to pick up.  drove 14 miles each way to Coral Springs from Pembroke Pines, go through three tolls each way one hour total drive just to find out at the front desk that they didn't have any order under my name. Showed the email at the girl in the front counter (She was very nice, Stressed out and apologetic, I have to tell her that she was not doing anything wrong and thank her for the assist) and she said that the order was cancelled because they didn't have the item. Never received a notification email and I went there a couple of hours after receiving the ""your order is ready"" email.The icing on the cake is the email that I received today saying that I canceled the order and my refund is on the way. I didn't cancel the order. The nice girl in the front desk did. She said that they will cancel the order and then send someone to find the item and told me that I will need to pay for it again. The guy that went to look out for my item never came back and after a long while she said that they were out. On other occasion with another pick up at store order, I never received the ""your order is ready for pick up"" but instead other email saying that my order was reverted because I didn't pick up my order on time.Really bad experience all around.Just once I have had a satisfactory experience at Target.All yours,Juan Arasaorder # 9067533649569"

Also, ""She drives a distance so not always arrives at 10:00"".  Called the Chanhassen, MN store.  There is no tech employee working there today either. Do not buy a phone at Target if you anticipate any ongoing assistance.  Not one bit helpful."

603,0,I don't give my money to just anyone. Throughout my adult life I’ve shopped at a lot of places but overall not has been as good of an experience as target. People are from the store is clean check out smooth have a good selection and they have some stylish clothes but Marco if you ask for?
1848,0,Don’t order from Target.com if you don’t want to be disappointed. I order serval house hold appliances and 4 of them didn’t even deliver. I was surprised and very hurt because my family members was waiting on some special gifts.
1414,0,"I asked a Target employee at the Blaine store (usually a good one) why they don't require masks, as some other retailers do. The reply showed a lack of knowledge about the virus, and about getting political with a customer. A big no no, I would think! She replied, first of all that only those who are sick need to wear masks. Since you could be ill for several days with the virus, without any symptoms, this is obviously false! Then she proceeded to say that, ""when the president wears a mask, we all will"". What a BAD example! It sounds to me like Target doesn't want to offend Trump supporters, by asking them to wear a mask. And I think Target employees need better customer service training. I would give 2 stars but previous visits there were good."

I needed these items immediately so I called to cancel I was advised by the online representative that I could not cancel the order that I should wait until I receive it an return. Why can’t I cancel , this is crazy and unfair. You can provide what I needed so I have the right to cancel and not waste my time returning. I was h/u on 2 times when requesting supervisor, and called store no one answered. This was my 1st and last time dealing with Target. I shop online all the time no other company is like this terrible company. Customer service is (0). I live in Miami Gardens, Fl I will surely tell others never order online here."
649,0,I purchased some gift cards online waited 20 days and have not received them. Turns out Target does NOT provide a tracking number for gift cards that are purchased online? The only thing they can do is send me new gift cards so I will have to wait another 7 - 10 business days to see if they arrive? Never ever again will I purchase gift cards from Target.com! This has been incredibly inconvenient…..

1222,0,"I will never do another registry with target ever again in my life, nor will I ever recommend anyone to do so! The worst customer service, and delivery service I’ve ever received. Every item that I got off my wedding registry came with many issues. First, I was gifted what was supposed to be a gray hamper instead when I received it it was black, and they told me that they cannot do a refund or an exchange, that I would have to call my gift giver and have them take it back and return it for the CORRECT  color that was ON my registry! Second, I received two packages to my home, the target boxes, and internal boxes were all damaged, so much so that I thought my appliances would be broken (they somehow were intact), however many items were missing from the package, I had to call corporate and wait on the phone for an hour and a half to have them resend out the items, which I still have yet to receive. Lastly, I had to return a registry item in store. Instead of doing a simple gift card for the cost of the item, I waited for 45 minutes, while they told me that they could not do the refund, and then asked me to call my gift giver, and ask them how much they paid, what card they used, what their email was, and what their phone number was, also they can. “ track the order”. They told me that if I did not call my wedding guest and ask her these extremely inappropriate and embarrassing questions, that they would not give me a refund. Beyond inappropriate, unprofessional and humiliating! Worst service DO NOT REGISTER OR ORDER ANY ONLINE ITEMS!"
776,0,My local Target 🎯 needs to restock 🤣 seriously I get the idea of having a smaller size Target like a CVS but I am just confused as to why there is a shortage? No shopping carts as well 🛒 I get why ( live in a area with a large homeless population ) but I really needed a little cart assistance to get my items to the car.

323,0,"Target’s customer service is HORRIBLE when it comes to making returns. I’ve never had a positive experience. In fact, I’ve had too many negative ones to even explain them all here (including today’s experience). Do not buy anything of value from this store if there’s any chance you may return it. They are literally the worst."
755,0,"Visited Target’s website and confirmed the item I was looking for was in stock at my preferred location, only to get there and it was not. What’s more is, the employee working in the “Tech” department actually stated that Target, his employer, “does a really bad job updating their inventory”. Seriously? Hey Target, if you’re interested, I have screenshots of your site stating my desired item was available in your Mishawaka, IN store when it wasn’t."
32,0,"THINK TWICE BEFORE SHOPPING TARGET. They are the LEAST CUSTOMER FOCUSED retailer I have ever dealt with. They don't even deserve 1 star. THEY send the wrong item. THEY will NOT REPLACE. THEIR automated service kept telling me to press 2 if that was another order & EVERY TIME THEIR automated system said 2 wasn't an option. IF I WERE STUPID ENOUGH TO REORDER, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY SHIPPING. My order was split tender. My credit card was charged appx the amout of this item, but they won't credit my account. All the so-called customer service clerk could do was read a script. No other retailer treats customers this way. THROW away a customer instead of trying to keep them. RIDICULOUS. Several years ago I called corporate with A QUESTION & ENDED UP PART OF A BREACH. THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE RISKS & AGGRAVATION."

The packing slip said that both toys were enclosed in the package, yet the box was too small for the second toy’s dimensions. Target’s online customer service was no help. At first, the representative instructed me to search all around the outside of my house for the package. There was a language barrier and she had a difficult time understanding that I already had the package in hand, but an item was missing from inside. Finally, she offered me a refund, but moments later she informed me I would have to wait for two days for the item to turn up before requesting a refund. Frustrated, I sent a message to Target via Facebook. A rep responded promptly and promised a refund to my bank account within several days. Three weeks later, still no refund. I contacted Target again via Facebook. This time, the rep sent me a gift card promptly. I did not want a gift card, I wanted a refund. Also, the amount of the gift card did not include the tax I paid on the toy. I am disappointed with this experience with Target. I am a RED card holder and shop at Target at least once a week. My local store is excellent, but I can’t recommend online shopping until their customer service and attention to detail improves."
2092,0,"If I could leave no stars I would. The phone in customer service is terrible!!! I had a question/problem with a card and ordering the phone in help absolutely knew nothing they had me repeat my question over an over..it wasn't that hard..two people later I got a ""specialist"" who was so annoyed that she had to help. Over an hour an a half just to order my items. I would have given up but it was a gift card. Then I couldn't even order all my items as I went over the card amount and online would not let me use another card to pay the difference. Horrible experience!!!!!"
672,0,"Target does steal your money. I am 76, a widow, and on a fixed income. I admit to being scammed by a very legitimate looking Microsoft Windows scam, but the scam locked my computer. Long story short, I purchased a $500 gift card as part of the scam - WHICH I NEVER USED, OR EVEN SCRATCHED THE CODE - and after two letters to the CEO **BRIAN CORNELL** requesting the money be returned, no response. I could have scanned the gift card and receipt, and police report was sent to him, but altho earning almost $20 million dollars last year, he chose to Ignore my request. Company policy is that gift cards cannot be returned, but I wrote to him, as head of the company, to ask if he could, due to the circumstance, make an exception. I have so much proof. Apparently TARGET needs MY $500. Ethical company?  I think not."
2081,0,"I've shopped from Target's online store twice and I haven't gone back since. I find myself laughing whenever I get an email about a ""sale"" considering their prices are ridiculous. My last purchase was over 3 items and it was pure hell getting my packages because they use Fedex shipping. It took almost 2 weeks and numerous calls to Fedex staff (it got to the point where I had to contact a higher up instead of dealing with regular representatives) because my package was suppose to be delivered in less than a week. The Crock Pot that I ordered for my mother wasn't even worth the stress because while it looked fine upright and from a distance, you turn the pot upside down and there's smudged paint on the edges of the pot and there was dents in the boxing when I finally received them. I'd rather shop at Walmart."

They give 5% off that I have no access to because the card won’t go through EVER.I like the store, but I have yet to be able to use my Target credit card. In store or on line I can’t use it. So most of the time I  now shop at other stores.I have tried 3 times to resolve this by phone. (They change my pin… and they send me by mail my new pin) And guess what?!STILL DOESN'T WORK!!Card will not go through☹️I run a business and don’t have time to figure this outSo I’m done with Target. Lots of other stores out there to shop at"

1107,0,"Target's shopper service SHIPT has been a lifeline when my husband & I were both too ill, or the weather was too awful, to get in a car and go shopping! SHIPT has been great. The extra added benefit was to discover online items that I never would have discovered if I was standing in front of the shelves. You can also build your grocery list across a couple of days. It allows you plenty time to create your list from all the possibilities that they will deliver for you. I haven't minded that it might cost me a little more in order to tip my shopper. Believe me they really earn their tips!"

I went straight to store on the same delivery date and the manager gave me a number to call. They sent UPS back out to get it and it was delivered to Target on 1/5. I have call 10 times and I keep getting 5 to 7 business days. I just called again and I got 5 to 7 business days. I have not gotten a call, email, or anything to let me know what is going on.

I returned the item to Target at the Metroplex in Conshohocken and received a refund for the item, but not the shipping. I was told to call Target.com which I did.  However, they do not return shipping fees. So, in addition to sending me the wrong item, they stole my shipping fee. I've had nothing but a run-around with Target."

The order was 4 days early, but it was damaged.  Contacted customer support and no one understood English! I was informed to ship a king size bed back.  I do not own a truck.  I now have a defective bed.  I will NEVER order from Target.com again.  This experience was complete BS."

2611,0,"I am so disappointed with the experiences I have had every single time I have called the Target RedCard Customer service. I'm providing reoccurring business by having this credit account open and being a big fan of my local target store. Obviously not even a minuscule portion of total business, but customer service is truly key! Every time I have had to contact the customer service department with red card services, it has been an awful experience and I am hung up on for asking about discrepancies within my account.. I will be closing my RedCard due to the issues I had with my balance and being wrongfully charged, and then the matter of this being handled... I would not recommend getting a RedCard if you are expecting to have good customer service. Never in my life have I experienced something similar.."
1613,0,"Personally I don't shop at Target often, but EVERY SINGLE EXPERIENCE I've had there has been wonderful! All of you people giving one star reviews of the store because of an ad that wasn't targetted at you, should find better hobbies than being a racist yourself❤Coming from a 22 year old white girl from Texas. Y'all gotta get it together, this is ridiculous. Great store, great customer service. It's an ad, get your panties in a wad about something else."
2023,0,"The first experience with pick up, was terrible 👎I order two ankle boots for both of my granddaughters to wear for Picture day. I received a email my order was ready to pick up, i get there, and there is a cancellation on their end. Which means they dont have it in stock. I was soo disappointed i left with no boots and to make matters worst, they charged my card. Why would they charge my card if i didn't leave with the boots. I will never again use target pickup. Target employees don't feel responsible and the managers will just tell you to call target.com... To all customers, when using target pick up, online it will tell you the item you looking for is there, once you placed the order, you get that email your order, you have a order number, then you'll receive a second email your order ready for pick up. Now it charges your card. This is when Target disappoint their customers.. now! it doesn't necessarily mean your order is ready or there, the store don't even have the item. Not enough hand power to do the simple thing like update the system or conduct a daily inventory so that the customers don't waste their time and money. It so sad, now i have to wait 2 or 3 days for my refund. What if that was the only money i have left, what are my granddaughters wearing for family picture day at Jcpenny.Target.. an apology is not what the customers want to hear."
2323,0,"I ordered a TV stand/bookshelf as a gift for my daughter.  FedEx delivered the large carton to my home.  They receive a ""NO STARS"" rating for leaving it propped up against my garage door in the rain even though I was home at the time.  (They also did not ring the doorbell).  Since the box was wet, I figured that it was ruined. So my husband and I opened it.  Amazingly, it was packaged so well with styrofoam that the rain had not damaged it at all.  But when we took all of the pieces out to look them over, we found out that the Wooden piece that was the top of the Stand had a big scratch on it.  I reached out to the manufacturer to try to get a new top, but they did not have any in stock.  So I had to return it.  Target was fantastic.  Customer service on the phone was excellent, and when we decided it would be easier to just take it back to the store to return instead of trusting FedEx, the Target store employees were extremely polite and made the return process very easy.  I will be ordering from them again."
2168,0,Bought ebay gift cards with red card was told by ebay must use gift cards with paypal. Paypal says no you cant use those and you can get no refund so you are screwed. Thanks Target . Oh yea and have fun getting me to pay for it.
589,0,"First the distribution of your reviews is bimodal.  Love or hate it that should tell you something.  For the last three years I have kept track of what % of my list was filled by Target.  Normally, just over half.  Today it was 100%, sort of.  My first two items razor blades and floss picks were and easy find.  I needed toilet bowl bleach and after some searching I found it.  I needed shoe laces and a little shoe glue.  No luck.  I talked to and employee and discovered Target does not keep all of their shoe laces in the same place.  Duh! No shoe glue but the nice employee got a substitute that might work.  For the first time in 3 years hitting 100%.  Maybe the loss of 50% of my business was related to the remodeling where old habits take you to the wrong place.  You know there is a field of study that looks at man and environment interactions it is found in the human engineering section of psychology departments and not in marketing.  Target it seems to believe if you keep customers moving circular patterns they will buy more with out considering individuals like myself who buy less because everything has been moved into unfamiliar locations.  I think it was WC Fields who described marketing as people you don't know trying to sell you something you don't need with money you don't have.  He was right."
1182,0,This place looks so nice and ha nice things but customer service is the worstYesterday my daughter and I went there to shop some Nintendo games and she was missing one. We can’t get any kind of help.Very sAd and mad.
1106,0,They lie. I ordered something through Target.com and they charged my card. The charge went through fine. I could have bought the same item elsewhere for the same price but I thought I'd try Target. Then they credited my card and cancelled the order blaming my credit card company.The truth is their 3rd party market place is abysmal. The company likely had inventory problems and since Target.com let's any questionable or not company partner they are not trustworthy.Now I'm scrambling to get what was a widely offered black Friday manufacturer offer that is no longer available.Target partners cannot be trusted and Target doesn't care.
66,0,"Hey Dee,Stop the ""hate"" crap. We are not hating anybody or any thing. I am sure all the folks who work at Target are nice people. But you, like so many others, totally miss the point. We are referring to what they are exposing our children to! They are marketing gay and trans ideology to our children. Wake up! Most of us don't care about what your beliefs are, or what your sexual orientation is, or any of that. They are going after our vulnerable children. Have you not seen some of the books being given to elementary children? Discussing all types of ADULT sexually-themed topics? And Target donated over 2 million dollars to schools to do just that. ""Educate"" our children on WOKE ideologies. THAT'S what we find disgusting. Now do you get it?"

Then I get a call from him, they hired someone else. I said--a job fair & ONLY 1 cashier was needed? Said yes. I told how disappointed I was. He told me to apply again in Dec. /Well that would be after Christmas help was hired. He obviously wasn't intending on hiring me. ?Because I'm over 55yrs old. & I have years of experience in retail.

This isn't my first terrible experience purchasing from target online. I purchased chairs that came and were NOT the measurements that were stated online.

The reason why I spend so much at target vs other stores is because they fully believe in being an inclusive Brand, they aren’t afraid to do what’s right and be supportive even when faced with opposition. Go target! This is what you call GOD turning a negative situation and making it for your good. She has doubled in sales since the situation arose. I’m sure the moron who went out of her way to start this grass fire never expected it would gain this company more revenue lol"
591,0,"I recently purchased a Keurig Duo from Target. No problem with Target. The coffee maker is terrible. The carafe leaks. I have contacted Keurig and they fail to respond. All they do is send me advertising. As I researched this, it appears to be a design flaw that they ARE aware exists. I finally purchased a Mr. Coffee 12 cup carafe and corrected the problem myself. All I wanted was a response from Keurig, and got none. Will never purchase their products again."

2443,0,"The first experience ordering from Target online was great. I ordered on a Sunday, and the stuff arrived on Tuesday. I was so impressed that I immediately ordered more stuff on the following Sunday. Everything I selected said 2-day shipping, and the order was estimated to arrive Wednesday. On Wednesday, I receive several different emails telling me that part of my order will be delayed, and that it may take until December 12th to arrive when I ordered on November 25th. Then the following couple of days I receive more emails telling me specific items have shipped, and yet when I go to track them all it says is that the shipping label was created. Are you kidding me? Every day is April 1st at Target HQ it seems. Target doesn't seem to know the difference between two days and two weeks. Guess I'll be going back to Walmart, as this is without any doubt the worse online ordering experience I've ever had."

2452,0,"I used to love shopping at Target but it has become just another greedy corporation. I purchased items and it says right on my receipt & online that I have 14 days for a price adjustment. 2 days after items were purchased, they went on sale (15% off) so I called for the price adjustment. I was told there were exceptions/exclusions to the price adjustment policy. Since when?!?! I’ve never experienced this from Target. I checked online this morning when I called & it didn’t say that my items were excluded in the fine print. I called back after work & spoke with a supervisor in the evening. He reiterated that he can’t adjust the price due to these items I purchased being part of the exclusion. He said to go online & read the fine print. In a matter of a day, they added this exclusion policy to the website!! I let the supervisor know that I KNOW it didn’t say that before. He responds that they had to add it online since many customers called about the same thing since it was a well sought after item. That shows how many people they lied to & stole money from! Disgusting. Go to Walmart."
2025,0,Pick up service SUCKS!  I drove 15 miles because this one particular Target had an online only item in stock that I couldn’t find anywhere else. I couldn’t pick it up within the three days so I extended it for another three days and I knew it was probably a bad idea to extend because of this very situation. I get there and I wait for 20 minutes while the employee tries to look for the items in the back. She comes out three or four times telling me she can’t find it and she’s checking somewhere else. She even calls the associate in the department that this was from to check the go backs and the stock. To no avail she then calls the supervisor which takes another 10 minutes. When all is said and done I wasted one hour round-trip travel and 30 minutes in the store to find out that they had sold my items even though I was charged when I ordered them! The supervisor told me they would not be getting anymore this year and that they were -3 of my item!! Yes those were my 3!!! How the hell do you have a pick up service and why do you allow extensions if your associates can’t follow a simple order!? The supervisor then told me to call Target.com to maybe get the order refunded. What?? My card was already charged! Absolutely disgraceful service. I hope your Christmas sales plunge.

722,0,"I had ordered a television set for online pickup. The television set worked for less than 2 weeks. I called the store and said I no longer have the box. They said I can return it because I should have the order # and info in my email. when I get to the store, they started playing games saying I wasn't told that and who did I speak to. It's only 2 women working in customer service and neither of them told me that. The call log is in my phone. Why would I come in the store with a 40 inch tv if I did not call? I left the tv set there and walked out. I was not going to be riding around with a tv set in my car. I was not going to be in the store arguing with people running the risk of getting arrested. Why didn't they ask me for my name and phone # so they could input the info in the system and have record of the situation. A  lot of people do throw the boxes away. They don't have room or feel there is no need to keep. There should be other ways to verify the serial # and make sure the person is not playing games with the merchandise. I don't like being called a liar. They could have said on the phone since you don't have the box, we can only exchange or issue a store gift card. She told me I could return to the store and that's what I did. A television should last more than 2 weeks."

It super frustrating, also super annoying when you receive a order from online that wasn’t even your item, and they don’t do anything about it until you complain and it was for you family photos.

EVEN when I go in the next day, the front area with all the drinks is packed. They just don't care. Not using same-day delivery again."

I even changed the location of one item to PREVENT from having to go to multiple stores for only TWO items. However of course AFTER purchasing the items one of the items were no longer in stock causing me to have to pick up from another store or wait until after Christmas for it to be shipped. I am so upset because in order to cancel my item I will have to wait 5 to 7 business days to receive a refund!!! Target needs to update the system when an item is purchased in store and online in order to have accurate information ONLINE!!!!!! I will avoid shopping on target.com because this is ridiculous!!

Recently, I just head the STUPIDEST go-around with them. I ordered a patio set. The table was available for store pickup only, and the chairs would ship to me. I go to pick up the table and they only had two in stock and both were damaged. I asked the person in the store to please go ahead and cancel the entire order. Well, they went ahead and shipped me the chairs anyway. I called customer service three times to try to get the order cancelled and got told twice that they could ""intercept"" the order once it had shipped, then the last guy I talked to was the rudest person ever, and I am just done. I will not be shopping there anymore."

I think that Target is a great store for clothes shopping and/or makeup. I love buying makeup from target because its a good price and there is a large selection to choose from. Therefore I recommend Target and had an overall great experience."

The last time I called the same lady answers tell me she’s going to figure it out, I hear her talking to other people in the back and then hangs up. By this point I am very fed up, so I drive there they didn’t have them. We find a lady who was stocking she goes in the back and tells us that THE TRUCK WILL BE IN TOMORROW MORNING WITH A WHOLE BATCH OF THEM. Target will not be getting my service anymore."

She now only has 2 or 3 dresses that fit her and she has needed clothes for months but waited at long as she could. She has no pants and barely any shirts that for her. And I think it's unfair for someone to yell at her like that for pretty much no reason, and yes I get covid-19 is bad everywhere but she can't even buy clothes now.

1930,0,"Absolutely terrible customer service- I am shocked and appalled. I placed an order on 12/12 and opted for 2 day shipping. I was guaranteed delivery on 12/17 (birthday of the person whom it was a gift for). Already taking more than twice as long as 2 day shipping should but it was the weekend and around the holidays so I understood. A week passes and they haven’t even shipped the order and the delivery date was pushed back to 12/23. I called to ask what was up- the person issued me a $10 gift card for my troubles but GUARANTEED the package would arrive by 12/23. I received an email later that night saying it was on its way. Then I check the status on 12/22 and it still hasn’t shipped - delivery date is now 1/3. Which was weird because of the shipping email I received. I called back asking where it was and was hung up on. Called back again, upset that I was hung up on and that my order was no where to be found - the guy said it is out of stock and that’s why there’s a delay. I asked why if my order already shipped why it matters if it’s in stock; he couldn’t answer. But he said for my troubles he would refund me and GUARANTEED I would still receive my item. I clarified - “it won’t cancel my order, right?”  At least 5 times. My refund was processed, and I log on today and what do you know - the order was canceled. I call back again, angry, and explain what happened: this guy says that there is no such thing as refunding without canceling the order. I have to wait til tomorrow to talk to someone higher up. Bottom line is they will say anything to get you off the phone. 0/5 experience."
2008,0,"Horrible online service!  I purchased 2 items online, but then immediately cancelled one - 6 days ago. I picked up the 1 item in the store the following day.  Emails and person to person conversation verified the 1 item cancelled.  They are still ""holding"" the original amount at 6 days later, yet they've already charged and cleared the correct amount.  Called customer service and kept referring to me as ""this case"", said that it will take 7-10 business days for it to fall off.  Completely ridiculous. They can immediately charge your account and have it clear in a day, but then take ""7-10 business days"" to release YOUR money. Will never shop online with Target to where I have to use a card, nor will I ever use a card for in store purchases, especially based on reviews and previous experience."
592,0,"Never had any problems buying from the actual target stores but when it comes to buying from the site target.com it is just a horrible experience!!! I ordered off there got the first time today so I could just pick my items up at the store. Well It told me that everything I wanted was in stock which was 2 different flavors of cat food (8 cans in one flavor and 8 in another flavor) so I bought all 16 cans of this. My order total was approved and came to almost 24 bucks. It was immediately took in out of my bank account in seconds after purchasing my order and then a little while later they sent me an email saying that my order was ready but 6 of the cans so about 8 dollars worth of my order was not there. So they had to be cancelled and the had a new price that they said I was charged which was $15.27. they sent me confirmation emails about half the order being cancelled due to being.out of stock but never once said anything about giving me the remaining left over money they charged me. I went to pick up my order and the receipt said I was only charged $14.23 and again I call my bank and they said no target took out 23.57, they never gave me any of that money back. And not only that there where 3 different totals that they said I was charged. The first email they sent me before they cancelled half my order said $23.57 which is the amount that was tookin out of my account. Then there was the pickup confirmation which said I was only charged $14.23 (I was never charged that) and then when I clicked on the email it took me to the target app page which said I was charged $15.27! So that is 3 different totals for the same order of 10 cans of cat food!! So not only did I get charged for something they dident have it give me they completely lied when they sent me that confirmation saying I was charged 14.23 ot the 15.27!! I was charged 23.57 which would of been the correct total if I would have got my full order but they dident have it all in stock!! I try calling for help with customer service for target.com and they refuse to do anything. I have screenshots, bank statements, receipts from ordering this order where it shows how much they took out of my bank account which proofs they took the 23 bucks but they just kept saying we don't charge you any money until after the order is picked up!! Well that's how it should be but that is NOT how it is!!!! I never once got any emails confirmation or nothing stating that they was putting the difference back onto my bank card or nothing!! It just went from an email saying I was charged 23.57 to an email saying some of the order had to be cancelled and your new total charge is 14.23! Never once said anything about the 8 bucks or so that they took from me!! I know it's only 8 bucks but it's the principal! They charged me for something they said they had in stock then after they took the money for something they said they had in stock then they say unfortunately it's not in stock and just keep the money?????? How is that ok?? I will never order from here again this website is completely garbage and I will never let anyone I know order from here!! So if u are someone who orders from here good luck your going to need it!!"

This was a brand new account with a valid email address, mailing address and phone number that were all verified. (For a person that had never had an account before) I submitted a review and they denied the purchase. I submitted another review because it is very easy to see if a gift card had ever been received. They denied again all in a matter of minutes. The person I spoke too said they understood but could not actually speak to the people making decisions. No one ever looked at my account or they would have corrected their mistake. They acted like I was trying to steal their measly 15 dollars that their company advertised to give. Over all horrible customer service."

Especially after my 12 year old said "" oh they have to be black"". So.... in overall, I won't buy it anymore, it's not that great of a product line anyways."
2406,0,"Recently, I have been shopping at Target (East in Colorado Springs) after work in the evening. Each time, there was only ONE cashier and  TWO self-check-out stations open. There were long lines of people waiting to pay for their purchases  -- up to 9 people in line. This week, I waited in the self-check-out line for 10 minutes. After I checked my 22 items, I was told that Target didn't accept checks in the self-check-out line. This was not posted anywhere!(Other stores accept checks in the self-check-out line.)Each time that I have shopped at Target in the evening, it took me 30-40 minutes to check out... Even though I like the products that Target sells, I am too tired, after working all day, to spend that kind of time checking out at Target.I will go back to shopping at King Soopers after work. Their managers monitor the cash registers and the lines -- in and out in no more than 10-15 minutes!Sorry Target, frustrating shoppers is not a good business model. Especially when they are waiting to give you their money!"

I ordered a product on Sunday, the shipping speed at checkout was for Wednesday. I checked the app on Wednesday and it had mysteriously changed to Thursday. Now it’s changed to Friday. When I spoke to customer service they stated that I would have been given an alert about shipping speed on checkout so I must be wrong. She basically said that it’s not their fault I was warned and I chose to buy the products anyway - but I’m free to return them if it’s a big deal. I’m very disappointed and considering closing my redcard."

The store always had a air of snobbish attitude in it but now the staff working their are beyond high toned they are just plain rude and crude to the customers .Also Target is so over priced it is a a joke. they sell cheap Chinese garbage just like Walmart and then jack the price up by 75% .It is a shame that stores like Target took over from other cool stores in America that had better stuff and gave you a fun time shopping in their store . Shopping at Target is like shopping in a nightmare .

506,0,"HORRIBLE delivery service. A $2 item was not available, which made my total fall below the $35. It showed my total still being around $45 (including taxes I presume and other fees) so ok fine. I was charged a fee of $15 because I fell under the $35 (NOT including taxes and other service fees) same day delivery. Now, the shopper was texting me before shopping, and I even received a text before checking out asking if I needed anything else. You would think this would be mentioned by the shopper/Target in these texts. I mean I was charged $15 for a $2 item. So silly. Doesn't make sense to me honestly. Just charge me for the item that wasn't available. Should have a better service and better customer service and let the customer know this with better warning. Just horrible delivery service if you ask me."

Is it company policy to allowyour employees to wear racial political messages on their uniforms? I find this type of behavior completely unacceptable.  Why would you want to make your guests feel uncomfortable,  and violated in this way?  I spoke with the store director, Craig, who said that he fully supports this employee wearing a political logo on her company required uniform.  Needless to say, you have lost a lifetime customer due to your political promotion"
675,0,"In December 2020 I purchased a Roku Stick and a 2 year Allstate extended warranty through target.com.   About 3 months ago, it stopped working so I started to see how I could return it or have it exchanged, since it has over a year left of warranty.  I was getting nowhere and got busy so I gave up.Today, I decided to try again.I begin the return process and get the message that it is ""non-returnable"".  What???  I manage to get more info.  It gives me 6 reasons why an item may be non-returnable but not which one applies to me.  And no info on what to do as a next step.So, I figure OK, I probably got to go through AllState anyway.   Turns out Target.com has zero info on Allstate even though they sell the Allstate extended warranty.  So, I try googling Allstate and find tons of negative comments from people like me.  But no info on how to go about trying to get warranty service.  No phone#s, no contacts, nada.  I try the Allstate web site and only home and auto insurance is there.  Nothing on warranty of products.Back to Target.com.  I find a phone# for help.  I call it the robo-operator says it will pass me on to the appropriate number and am immediately hung up on.Next, I try the Target chat.  Rick, tells me I have to go to AllState.  I start to type out my past experience with that and he ends the chat while I'm in the middle of typing.   The reason stated, No Response from me.  I know they can see that I'm typing.  Just like we can see if they are typing.  What a jerk!Pretty sure this would apply to any electronic item you buy through Target.com.  Not sure about any other product or if you buy from a physical store.But, next time.  I will go to BestBuy or NewEgg or ebay or Amazon.  Never again, Target"

For many years, was store with good customer service all year around,  now target is  like  Walmart, u cannt ask question to the workers they act like deaft or they got actitud , they don’t want the customer bother them,  I live in plantation, and every time. I go  to target is a problem,  you cannt ask question, you need help nobody cannt help you, cause they ignore you. Today. I was there  and definetly I don’t go back.  They treat people bad and people overseas that come to target to buy a l lot to resale in their countries forget it  it’s worst.

I was given a case number.  24 hours later, no call.  I tried contacting the site again (via chat) and the agent simply disconnected me when I asked why no one had contacted me and asked that my order be delivered Today.  I called the customer support number and asked to speak to a manager.  I was placed on hold for over 20 minutes and finally was disconnected from the call.  I called again and this time I was finally transferred to a manager, Julia.  Not a very helpful person at all!  Instead of offering SOLUTIONS, or apologizing for the problems I was experiencing, Julia simply said that the RESEARCH team in charge of figuring out what was the delay in my order was really behind and she couldn't really tell me when they would call back.  Probably at least 72 hours ... She told me I could re-order the item for store pickup (at a much higher price of course).  She offered no real solutions and basically just sighed loudly because apparently, I was being an inconvenience!  When I asked what she did for the company she told me she was a CUSTOMER SERVICE manager ... Well forgive me then for expecting better service from Target!

Target has this thing where they start with UPS shipping then for the dumbest reason possible UPS transfers your package to the United State Postal Service as if UPS couldn't deliver to my door. On top of that either UPS or USPS lied in my tracking information saying they came to my door in an attempt to deliver my package on two separate occasions when they never did. I have a ring doorbell and I work from with my office having a clear view of the front door and they NEVER stepped foot in my yard at all. WORST delivery service ever. Now, I will for sure be ordering all my things from AMAZON and I  will let target delivery burn to the ground. P.S If I could get this review NEGATIVE STARS I would."
1490,0,I went to buy some stuff from target rochester hills Michigan. After I went to the self checkout I found one of the workers getting the disinfect wipes out off my cart without asking me and then he told me you can’t get more than one. That’s disrespectful from the team to touch someone Cart before he ask the client. Then I asked him why you don’t write that it’s only allowed one on the rack of the disinfectant wipes he left me to put them back without answering me. I was chocked with that bad behavior from that old worker there.  Very bad way to deal with customers.
2150,0,"I recently shopped Target online and arranged to pick up in the Huntington Station, NY store.  I was surprised at how easy it was and how quickly my items were retrieved for me.  I will be shopping Target in Huntington Station, NY again!  Great job, Target!"
2612,0,"Ordered an item for valentines day. Item was received, and wound up being defective. After calling Target customer service, I was told that I had to wait two days to report the item defective and request a replacement because it still showed that the order was ""in transit"" in their system. I waited the two days and called back, only to be told that they would not replace the order, and that the most they would do was issue me a refund two after they received the defective item back. Since I found this ridiculous (especially due to the fact that I was told two days earlier that the replacement would be no problem), I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor told me that the issue would be handled, and that my replacement would be sent out that day. 6 days later, I received an email stating that, again, there would be no replacement sent, and that I would need to send the item back to them, receive a refund, and re-order the item. I have never, in my life, experienced such horrible customer service. Couple that with the fact that several of your support staff (inclusive of supervisors) lied to me about repairing the situation. You have lost a customer, and I will share this story with everyone I presently know, as well as will know in the future, so that they will think twice about shopping at your store as well."

Here's my most recent experience:I ordered TurboTax online, received an email saying that the activation code was emailed to me; however it was not.I talked to 6 Target associates at 6 different phone numbers over a 2 1/2 hour duration until someone was able to confirm that the email failed to send.He said he resent it but had zero confidence that it would actually be sent and was not willing to wait on the phone until the email was received and hung up on me.Additionally, he told me that no one at Target brick and mortar could help. He was mistaken.  A 15 minute trip at the Target brick and mortar store and my problems were resolved."

1653,0,"Whoever saying this is racist are absolute morons who don’t understand the definition of racism. First and foremost, white people benefit from racism, so therefore can’t face racism. Y’all have never faced systemic oppression. Second of all, this commercial was also for BLACK HISTORY MONTH, so why would white people even be mentioned? Third of all brands EVERYWHERE cater to white women from makeup, to hair products, and black women and/or men are left to struggle with finding the right foundation color for their skin. But none of y’all seem to care about that, bet y’all never had anything to say about it. But now that there is something in your everyday Target that specifically caters to black women and girls, y’all wanna feel left out?? Y’all wanna say “all women this” and “all women that” but didn’t think about “all women” when black women have not been thought about in the beauty industry since forever!! We are just now getting the catering we deserve because we never really had it, and y’all wanna be mad? Not everything revolves around you, you guys sound so entitled and it’s ugly."
1855,0,"I moved from NH to SC Dec 9th. Visited my daughter in Miami for the weekend. Went to target purchase stuff for her apartment they blocked my card when I called customer service they said it was because there was fraudulent activity November 4. I said so instead of contacting me you just shut off my card a month and a half later. I was assured by 12 customer service representatives, the 12 times that I called and had to re-process my complete order 6 times, ($1000 worth of merchandise at 30 min minimum to unload and load up) that they had activated my card. I spent five hours getting told lies by target representatives. They will not even compensate me now for the embarrassment that I sustained in this five hours, the fact that it’s been a month and a half since they detected fraudulent activities on my card and the fact that I was lied to 12 different times by representatives saying they had activated my card.  I hate Walmart but that will be my number one go to store from this point on.  I ended up using my credit card and therefore did not even receive the 5% discount for my red card. They will not compensate Me for that either. Completely incompetent lying company. They do nothing for their customers who make them what they are."
2518,0,"Absolutely will never order from Target again.  Be aware they do not track their gift cards under a certain amount (policy rules).  I ordered a gift card as well as gifts for registered bride.  The gifts were tracked and I received confirmation that they arrived.  The gift card was sent separately and there was no way to track it per customer service because ""the amount was so low"" $30 and it could take up to 2 weeks for it to arrive.  She told me I would have to contract the bride to see if she received it (really, how tacky)."
749,0,I placed my first online grocery order for pickup yesterday.  I only ordered a few items.  A box of jello and a frozen pizza which they can't screw up!  The only other item that I ordered was two bananas.  Doesn't sound too difficult right?  I opened the order and much to my surprize both bananas were rotten!  Loaded with brown rotted areas inside and out!  They looked as though they had been sitting for weeks!  Just out of curiosity I made a personal trip today and had to see for my self.  Most of the bananas were good.  The worst was much much better than what I was given!  What a shame that people who are depending on their shoppers to pick decent product out for them are so blatantly lazy that they don't take a few minutes to make decent selections for their customers.  I will never use this service again!
1476,0,"I love shopping at target not only convenient for me but has everything I need at a decent price. Great customer service, especially when you need help finding something and on returning items."
1349,0,"This review is of my grocery shopping experience only. I don't shop at Target for anything else, because their overall merchandise quality and selection is poor.Shipping is quick, and the $35 min. purchase for free shipping can go a fairly long way, if you choose Target's house brands. Make sure you request order consolidation, so that it ships in fewer parcels. Otherwise, you could get 1-2 items at a time, rattling around in a series of unnecessarily large boxes. At least, Target's email notifications let you know when boxes are shipped, in  transit, and delivered, so you can easily track how much of your order is coming and when. Overall, not bad and worth the savings on certain things."
1140,0,"what a shame target of pinole california and richmond ca. and especially the little cooperation of the employees, for not having an electric car for people with disabilities target you are a company that earns billions of dollars per year what a shame and frustration that you do not make an investment in those cars you stopped being my favorite store this is very frustrating !!"
1408,0,"Although my past experiences with Target have been good, it is important for customers to know that the Target in Lowell, MA does not practice safe distancing procedures, even though their website indicates that they do.  Although the majority of people were wearing masks, with the exception of when you enter the store, there are no signs or markers indicating which direction to go and how far apart to stand, nor were there ANY reminders.  Even though every customer should use common sense, there are those people who will not.  Things get even worse when you are at the checkout lane.  There appeared to be a line of over 20 people waiting, but we found out, from other customers, that those people were waiting to use the self-checkout registers.  Furthermore, there was no clear communication from the employees which register to go to.  Customers were lining up at any register they found open, without following the 6FT apart rule.  We also did not see anyone ""monitoring and metering guest access.""  My most disturbing experience was when a Target employee was attempting to exit the store, looking at her cell phone, unaware of how close she was to my proximity.  As a customer, I did not feel as though they were taking their customers' or their employees' health into consideration.  When almost every store, including Walmart, practices safe social distancing measures to protect their customers,  but Target resembles the same ""disorganized chaos"" one would often witness during the holiday season, my recommendation would be to stay away from the Target in Lowell."
241,0,Target has always set a higher standard from most stores. They make it comfortable to shop around. The store is well organized and clean. The employees are very friendly and willing to help. I would recommend Target to anyone looking to experience a relaxing shopping experience.
942,0,"My order has been cancelled three times for no other reason than they won't ship to forwarders like myus.com..well keep your stuff then, I'll shop at Walmart"
2052,0,"I used to love Target and so I thought since the employees were so friendly I would apply to work at Target. By day 2 I wanted to quit and I figured out that the employees who were so nice and helpful were just thrilled to have a friendly customer instead of having corporate mandated harassment thrown at them. Worked at Target, 4 years, as there isn't much opportunity where I live. MA Targets pay the same wage as low cost housing areas and so I know ""team members"" (targespeak)who live in their cars, or walk to work miles away in snow, or cant afford food etc etc. I, thankfully have a significant other with a well paid job so I left after being disrespected and told I was not working fast enough for 4 years, hmm, why did they keep me then? Because the expectations of corporate are unattainable thereby causing the leaders to believe that team members can do what corporate is asking thereby annoying the teammembers daily as we can never do a good job, it's just a sad place to work. I had 1 leader who understood that the expectations were insane so I didn't mind working when he was there. I quit 3 months ago and I have only been in once a month to grab some car tissues as I cant get them anywhere else. It's just sad because I used to believe they cared, they dont."
999,2,"Was at Target today with my 2 young boys and the explicit garbage that was coming out of the loud speakers made me nauseous.  I will not call it music because that's not what it was, it came direct from a sewer line of evil. How can you even think of putting such garbage over a loud speaker where the public can hear and worst of all, little children. Shame on you!!! Shame on the person who plays it. Shame on everyone hearing it and not speaking up. Get that filth off your speakers and let people shop in peace. Shame on you."
2176,0,"I had to tap a star to add my review when I honestly would give ZERO stars to the Target Red Card customer service. I had an unauthorized charge on my bank statement. They suspended my card, told me I was to receive a letter which never came, and pending their review, told me it might not be in my favor. WHAT! The charge was for school supplies. I’m 71 yrs old and do not have kids in school. I have missed the tax free weekend sales, cartwheel discounts and regular discounts associated with my card. My bank issued me a new card in 2DAYS. Target should have issued me a new Red Card immediately and dealt with their investigation on their own time. How stupid are they because I would have been spending money at the store in the interim. I agree with so many other reviewers. Their Online app is Neanderthal. Amazon is the best. Quick and easy. Take note Target executives...not smart on your part!"
194,0,"They are pushing trans ideology in their children's clothing section. They are predetors, and more concerned with an ESG score than running an actual business.

562,0,"We ordered a baby gift from a registry. Was supposed to ship in an adequate amount of time. When it didn’t arrive for weeks,  we tracked it and then called just to be told it had been delivered. We should check with our neighbors!  They couldn’t even tell where it had gone to…. So they did cancel that order and reordered and guaranteed a delivery date! Now within less than a week of the shower!  Well it didn’t come on the promised date!!! So now we don’t have the gift we planned on, most everything from the registry is already purchased, and we are extremely disappointed with such horrible service!   Won’t be using Target online again anytime soon!!"
1004,0,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I bought a night stand from there. While building it I noticed 2 cracked load bearing boards, which I glued and clamped and all the holes needed drilled out because they were not deep enough and would have cracked the boards installing the screws. There was also a repair that had been done to the front face using putty and sand paper, but wasn't re-stained so I had to touch that up. I also had to put in supports on the bottom shelf because there was none per design and would have sagged as soon as I put weight on it. I contacted customer service for a partial refund for my extra work on the stand and to save them return shipping fees. Their only options were to return the stand for a new one, but they were completely out of stock until for 3 months or return the stand for a refund. I made the stand usable after hours of building and fixing it so did not want to return it at all, just a discount of 10% or 20% or something. They refuse to answer me. So now I have to disassemble it and return it, which costs them much more in shipping than a discount. Then I have to wait for a refund and then purchase from someone else. Terrible customer service and a terrible experience!!!"
583,0,"Shipping was rushed and the lack of detail in the packaging shows it, the product was fine."
2433,0,The retail stores are fine. Their online service the worst on planet earth. They claim 2 day shipping that takes 7-10 days. I ordered a full case (12) of canned tomatoes from them. The box came split wide open. They had just put loose cans in a cardboard box with nothing to fill the box to keep everything from moving around. 5 of the cans were so mangled up they couldn't be opened. I emailed customer service. They agreed to replace the entire order. It just came. The same thing. 12 cans just thrown in a box with no packing material at all. The box also came split wide open with 4 cans so mangled I'll have to throw them away. Amazon they're not. Never again will I buy a thing from them. They use chimpanzees to pack orders.
2365,0,"Very rude Customer Service. I used Chat online to ask for help reguarding an order I never ever received. The gift I purchased online was a bottle of perfume for my mother for Christmas. Target stated it was shipped, but it was not shipped because USPS stated they have not received the shipment yet but will begin the process to ship the purchase when they receive it. The man on the online Chat argued that it was shipped! Excuse me, NO it was NOT!  None of this okay! Has Target turned into thieves now, who steal credit card income for purchases without shipping them, and liars who promise gifts will be received before Christmas, when they are in actuality missing?! I have shopped here with and for my parents, with and for my daughters for over thirty years and Target just lost a good paying customer! Thank you so much, for destroying my mothers Christmas! Target Scrooges!"

I CANCELLED MY ACCOUNT AND I WILL NOT BUY THERE NO MORE.STUPID people they have as Customer Service. WATCH OUT PEOPLE!"
2240,0,"I like Target Store. But please just be careful using their 5% discount card if you ever have insufficient fund, they will not try a second time to get the money.  You will be  immediately charged in your bank account heavily for that . So for even for any amount you can be charged while trying to get 5% discount. The card does not work as a debit card, that if you have insufficient fund it will not go through at the point of purchase, it works as a check, so the payment may not come out off your account on the day of purchase. So if you have NSF, Target will charge you and the bank will also charge you. For me I thought the card went through until I saw the charges in my account, I called Target customer service to make the payment I then found out I was charged again for a returned check. All these for a 5% discount. WowNOT GOOD AT ALL."

2549,0,I use to love target! It was my go to store for everything but recently I avoid all targets . For about a year or two the store has taken a bad turn . It’s less organized ! The shoe department is so unorganized that you can’t find anything and most of the time I just walk away . The clothes are never in the right place. I don’t know what you guys are doing but it looks horrible! I over hear a worker saying how they don’t schedule people in every spot everyday . That the baby department went two days with no one cleaning it. I could just imagine how that’s how it is everywhere in the store. Whatever manager took over clearly sucks at organizing and scheduling .

I did not know that if you buy more than 100 dollars you can not pay with check unless you have built up a ""history"" .  I was humiliated in line while my check was rejected.  I had to get cash from the crappy ATM to pay.  I find this policy completely insane.  Obviously my check is not welcome and there is no posted policy about NO CHECKS.   So I'll be spending my money via my checking account at Walmart, Meijers,  and Kroger --all stores with far superior customer service!"

Now that I've been beat up by some of these stores, I find myself returning to the one I loved in the first place (over 30 years at Target).  I am so pleased with target.com, and found quickly that target.com is able to meet MOST of my shopping needs. In my opinion this is one of the few stores left with integrity, if that's even possible in this day and age of deceit.  Thank you Target for taking me back as a loyal customer!  5% off if you get a debit or credit card which I will do soon!!!!!!"
2232,0,"I do not drive, so I use the Shipt ap and have groceries and sundries delivered to me. Shipt recently added a local Target store, so I thought I’d give them a try, since their prices on many items are cheaper. Bad idea. Though my Shipt shoppers do a fine job shopping and delivering to me, the quality of the items, especially the fresh food, is consistently bad. So I thought, well I just won’t buy and produce or meat or dairy from there. I’ll just buy dry goods and shelf stable items. Bad idea. Even their dry items like whole wheat flour are out of date. Mine was 7 months expired when it came to me. Now, since I use the Shipt app, Shipt happily makes it right for me and credits my account. But when I received 2 jars of peanut butter (each a different style) that were both bad (one mislabeled and one hard as a brick) I called target corporate. They sent me gift cards to compensate for my trouble. Ok great. I’ve got a little extra here even. That’s nice. But Shipt does not recognize gift cards. Ok so I’ll try their online website. Sure I need to buy a little more to get free shipping, but my kitchen can always use some foil and plastic wrap, besides the generic Prilosec that I decided to stock up on. The order went thru, it was shipped quickly, and when I opened the box a weird weird odor came wafting out at me. EEEWWWW! This smells like the stinkiest hospital stank I have ever smelled! What on earth could possibly make this smell like this?? All I got was parchment paper, plastic storage bags, and my omeprazole (generic Prilosec)  It was the omeprazole. Having a look at the label, it was made in Israel!!!! I’m so flummoxed about this, I don’t know what to do. I guess I’ll try calling customer service, but this is absolutely ridiculous!! JUST DO NOT SHOP AT TARGET!!! EVER!!!"

I will never shop at Target again and the outsource customer service in India is garbage and they don't know a damn thing on how to work a system nor what customer service really is."
791,0,"I do not like your new brand  ""Good & Gather"" cinnamon raisin breakfast bread that has replaced Archer Farms brand. You state that Good & Gather brands will be better but they don't compare. Also there is nowhere to sit since Star Bucks have removed their tables. This made shopping at Target more enjoyable and relaxing. Hopefully seating will return after the pandemic. No seating makes it difficult for the older shoppers who may need to rest."
1524,0,If I could I would Score Target a 0! They are the worst company out there! I tried to return an item today and was told they aren’t doing returns because I could have contaminated what I purchased from them with the Corona Virus!What if they contaminated me or my family when they sold the product!Is it ok for me to die because we needed toilet paper?They could care less about there customers! They will start doing returns after 4-16-20 Well if these items have been contaminated why would me being able to return them after 4-16-20 cause them to not be contaminated anymore! They as a company are just taking advantage of the public that trust the return policy they have in place not a policy that changes with no notice so customers that already have enough problems or have fallen on hard times get further taken advantage of!

We gave up when we read about our information being given out!!! and reading target-wallmart-bestbuy's reviews!!! to my fellow Americans! we have so much buying power but we do not use it. we need to come together as one and tell these companies what we want and expect from them. they are selling us stuff that we are lucky if it will last till we get home!?!?! then the company that makes the stuff just waste our time waiting on a phone?? what's wrong with us. do we like being used like this??

2467,0,Do NOT order anything heavy and/or furniture from Target.com. They will deliver it damaged and they do NOT have any normal way of picking it up from you and delivering you a refund. In my opinion this is an ageist company. They do not cater to an elder clientele. I have contacted them 6 times to see where my refund is and all I get is the run around on the phone. I will be ordering all my furniture items from now on from a reputable company which Target no longer is.

2446,0,2 day shipping ...try 4 day shipping and it's still in transit to carrier. I spent the required 25 minimum for the 2 day shipping and hasn't shown up yet. Why advertise 2 day shipping if it isn't possible!! Very disappointed!!!Update: Received both my packages for one order of popsockets 11/29/18. 2 in 1 package and supposed to be 3 in the other. I ordered 5 in total and received only 3. Called customer service and they told me that I have to wait 48hrs only then can they issue a refund. He also stated that it is possible that it may come in another package with the SAME tracking number. Highly unlikely! I placed the order on 11/24/18 so certainly does not fall in a 2 day shipping bracket. Not only did they drop the ball with shipping they also did not complete my order and probably won't be able to get my refund without a headache. 😡
219,0,Target is one of the worst companies out there!  DO NOT SHOP THERE. They are horrible!!  I tell everybody I know NOT to shop there or boycott the company!!!  Target you suck!!!
429,0,"I ordered gift cards for my contractors for $25.00 each about 4 of them but my admin didn't realize the gift cards could only be used for Disney, and honestly I wouldn't have paid attention either. I called target to see if they could possible just switch out the cards so the contractors could enjoy the gift cards. The rep said there was nothing they could do. I will never shop target again in good faith they could have switched out the damn gift cards that would have been great customer service. It's sad that I will need to spend extra money, and waste money at the same time because target refuse to help me out. I will spend my money where my business is appreciated. This could have been resolved very easily. Thank you Target for nothing!!!!!!"
708,0,This has been my experience as an on-line purchase with Target. I purchased a few things on a weekday and one item came so fast I didn't even expect that to find it so soon as it did inside my home mailbox 📬 Speedy service and Loved the item. It was just what was seen in the photo and the quality was just as well what was seen in the photo. Maybe sometimes our devices that we are using might pick up a different coloring then the actual color but they do put the color name of the item in their system so this was just as it stated next to the item. I still have yet to receive the next few items but they are headed in this direction very soon now so I am very well pleased with my experience and their services. I don't order frequently but whenever I have I get the best service ever better than some places I have shopped at online so no complaints to you Target. Target is nice to have an online store you can depend on. Maybe it depends on your location where you live I don't know that but I have not experienced anything bad from them. Thanks to You Target!
2470,0,"I ordered a sofa from this company and I paid an extra $15 for delivery inside my door. I received a message from their delivery company to say that I would receive my sofa today (16th November) between 8am and 6 pm and the delivery method was to leave it outside. I contacted both the delivery company and Target to get this changed as in my sales contract. The delivery company were very apologetic but told me that Target had obviously misinformed them and they could not deliver into my home. Target told me that the delivery vehicle was contacting the driver to make sure he delivered inside the house. The delivery arrived and the driver wanted to leave the sofa on the pathway outside the block. He wouldn't entertain delivering it inside the door. As the item was 151 pounds in weight and I am handicapped, I had no alternative but to reject the delivery. Five minutes later, the delivery company phoned to say that the sofa would be delivered inside my door. I told the agent what had happened and he called his delivery 'hub' which informed him that the delivery wouldn't take place. Another call to Target to request a refund and this was sorted out eventually. Target did not once apologise to me. I have spent my entire day waiting for this delivery to find that Target let me down big style and not even a 'sorry'. Wild horses wouldn't tempt me to do business with this company again. My experience and other experiences on this site and the bad ratings lead me to believe that Target are a 'shareholder focused' only company. Their customers don't seem to come into the equation as far as excellent service is concerned. As long as we part with our money, that's fine but don't expect an apology when we get it wrong - because really, we don't care!!!"

1073,0,"I purchased 2 items online. At the checkout page, there was a 50-cent fee for a shopping bag listed with my items. I knew I didn't need their bag, but there was no button to click to remove it. I then saw that the fee was not added to the final price, so I took it as just illustrating what the bag would cost, should I need it. When I got the email confirmation of the order, again there was no bag fee added. Fine, no problem. When I went to the Target pickup desk, the woman came from the supply room with my items in a bag. I I told her I didn't need the bag, and did not purchase it. She said ""ok fine, I'll take it out [of the system]"". That sounds like when I checked my credit card statement, there would have been that bag charge added. Highly unethical !"

632,0,"I live next to Target in GLENVILLE, NY.They are the most disrespectful and dishonest neighbors.They have delivery trucks come at crazy hours of the night and some sit with their diesel engines running on and off for 2 hours while they are unloaded. Others just change out the the container part of the truck which is several loud bangs ....sounds like a car accident!They lie about the compactor that goes on beginning at 4a. It's loud enough to wake you in a the building next door with the windows shut and a fan on. They say it's not happening ...video shows it is!The parking lot is swept at all hours of the night....another loud maintenence machine. And...then in the winter...they plow after the regular plow truck with a backhoe.Seriously Target. I know why no one lasts in my apartment very long. And..Bring your Fed Ex business to a area where you aren't in a residential neighborhood. There are plenty of places you can ship from at nearby Targets in business areas. Maybe that would eliminate the need for excess sweeping and plowing around storage containers all night."

346,0,"If negative stars was an option, that’s what we would leave. I’ve never felt the need to leave a review, this was just frustrating enough to feel the need to express the experience. We ordered a $300 ticket item that never got delivered and all that we are being told as there’s nothing they can do. The responsibility of customer service has been passed off to a third-party call-center from another country that has no ability to assist. Pretty sad from a brand like target, might as well be Walmart !!"
558,0,"I have not ordered anything online from target in over 4 years. I decided to use my target card and order a set of 10 towels. It's been over a week that I placed my order and still have not received my order. I was in chat 2 days ago with customer service and they pretty much gave me the same Info was given online. Target uses Inland Logistics who by the way has 1 star ratings with all who left reviews.  Horror stories. Not sure why target continues using this company when the customer reviews are horrible. My package was shipping from NJ. I live in PA. With UPS, packages come in 1 day. I can't even track my package on the logistics website as it takes me to a blank screen. I was told by target to give it a few more days. What a joke. Whether I get my order or not and I have to request a refund, I will NEVER ever order from target online again! This put a bad taste in my mouth."

Kohl’s is a messy pile of stuff which makes no sense. Guess what, now that our local Target has changed up the store layout IT’S JUST LIKE KOHLS! It now has “areas” not aisles. I am a long-time shopper and everyone agreed with me that they lived Target because it made simple sense. Now, like Kohl’s, it is SENSORY OVERLOAD. I am no longer loyal or attracted, Target."

1336,0,The rating should have an option for worst service ever. This is with the customer service phone numbers for online order and red card mc. I was on the phone today for 3 hours and it was all wasted time that my issue never got resolved because the lazy customer service reps who are teleworking at home don’t want to work. I spend two hours with a rude uneducated American who gave me attitude because I was sick of telling my story since it was the 12th time and I’ll I told her was can I give you the reference number since the previous guy who was nice but obviously lazy and didn’t want to do the work to clean up the mess that was happening to the returns that the system was not allowing due to a “glitch” 4 people said but didn’t know what to do with the so called issue. But back to the uneducated American women who provided the worst customer service by far she was working the account saying it was almost resolved then she transfers me back to the main customer service line without saying anything and she had my phone number you would think after working the account for two hours she would call back... but no she obviously was just pretending to work while at home and placing me on hold for ever. So I called to talk to a manager over dealing with the little people but then the girl said she needs to have the manager call me back since he was on the phone....... guess what no call and it’s 9:26 pm and this was at 1:30 pm so the $45 dollars of items  I returned on July 6th will just be a loss I am done with calling there’s no point there all morons and explains why they only made it working at target.... Screw all you unhelpful public servants. I work for a call center I know what it’s like to be a public servant and it’s hard but I never provide poor customer service even to the a$$holes I just kill them with kindness and it sucks that customer service sucks everywhere. I don’t even want to do business with target anymore with how poorly the customer service is.
955,0,"I was at Target last night and accidently scanned a Target Mastercard for $100.00.  Sadly I did not want this card (I was supposed to scan a regular Target gift card for the $5.00 thing).  Anyway, Megan came over to help and though she told me there was no refunds on gift cards (I had finished the transaction -), she brought me over to customer service and called the manager, Quanum.  Both were super wonderful, fantastic, and terrific.  They treated me quite respectfully, and in the end resolved my issue.  I'm not a big shopper, but I will tell you now, with service like that, if I need anything my Target carries, I will be visiting that store.  Extremely courteous, really nice and took care of me.  Made me feel good to see such fine customer service.  Keep it up guys and gals!Kim"

19,0,"If I were able to rate Target and their inept customer server with negative stars, I would.  Since I'm unable, I will reluctantly give a single star.  I have had my order, for the same item mind you, canceled eight times now.  Three of the cancelations were pre-orders.  The system is kicking me out with three, obviously random, reasons for the cancelation.  My favorite is when I decided to attempt to order one of said item and a reason is I've exceeded the allotted number per household..lol.  I have argued online as well as called the corporate number.  I never dreamed both would be just as ignorant to both computer and web systems.  I kept insisting I speak with an individual who understood code as it is a problem that is going on with my account.  They kept telling me it isn't, while stating the numbers on the site are incorrect and just not updated correctly.  I explained to them that I had been watching the numbers decrease and attempted to explain to random fools how code works.  Then attempted to explain how their company line didn't hold water as I bought an xbox series x from target online.  I also was canceled during preorder and the day they were to put the item on the shelves I was canceled at 430am.  But they just kept repeating the same thing.  They have done nothing to help.  Their advice, this is ingenious, wait 24hrs... And try again!!  LMAO.  Right because if something is malfunctioning, it will just magically fix itself.  Meanwhile, I personally know people all over the country who have gone on the Target website and had NO problems with this exact item.  One person earlier this week bought the last two online for himself at a store.  I CAN'T BUY ONE OF THREE AVAILABLE!!"

I can’t say enough about their clean store in th face of our global pandemic!!! All employees wear PPE, always wiping things down, pleasant and helpful. Though Targets pricing is a bit higher then some competitors I feel it’s worth it for personal safety!!! Great Job Dickson City Target!!!!!"
2429,0,"TERRIBLE TELEPHONE CUSTOMER  SUPPORT FOR ONLINE ORDERS!!! The in-store experience at Target is always excellent, but Heaven help you if you ever need assistance with on order placed online! Target’s telephone customer service for online orders is absolutely pathetic! You will wait on the phone FOREVER to reach a live voice, only to find out that the live voice cannot speak English well enough to be understood! That’s because they answer in the Philippines (outsourcing is an insult to workers here in the USA), and to make things even worse, the phone reps are poorly trained! It took three tries to finally get through to a “specialist” (the reps pretend there are no supervisors present). On the first two calls the reps hung up when we asked for a supervisor because we simply could not understand their broken English. When we did reach the specialist on the third try, she lied and did not follow through on what she promised to do. All in all, a total of THREE HOURS was wasted on the phone with Target’s phone customer NON-service! We were forced to go to the store in person for face-to-face customer service. At the store, a pleasant young man named Kyle gave us excellent service. Kyle was efficient, courteous, and quickly rectified the problem. Thank you, Kyle. We were about ready to stop using Target forever because of the absolutely horrible experience we had with that attempted online order. Shame on Clarissa, that online specialist who did not follow through on the promises she made on the phone, and shame on the three individuals on the phone who preceded her – the three who most obviously did not care at all. Our shipment had to be delivered to the store (instead of to our home address) in order to get the two $5.00 Target gift cards. Even though we clearly selected our local store in Pennsylvania, the order wound up being delivered to Minnesota instead! What should have been an easy fix with the very first person involved on the phone turned into a painfully long ordeal! But no one on the phone cared enough to fix the problem correctly - not even that lying ""specialist"" Clarissa! So, ""two thumbs up,"" and many kudos to Kyle at the Stroudsburg, PA store for quickly and properly taking care of us. In fact, it is only because of Kyle’s excellent customer service that we will now continue to shop at Target stores (we have been long-term customers) - but NEVER, ever will we consider placing an online order again at target.com."
566,0,This is specifically about target.com ordered an iPad that they said my local target had in stock took the money out of my account only to be told they actually didn’t have it. Since I used my debit card to purchase could take up to a week to be reimbursed. Ridiculous! Make sure you call the store to verify they actually have product before ordering because target.com stock is useless!
2194,0,"My family has been a Red Card member since 2012.  Target got hacked and added pin # to the Red Card so we could no longer use it at the store.  I called today to figure out how to set the pin # and they told me the card was closed due to inactivity.  I don't think Target has a clue about customer service.  Target is not our main account and if they do not want our business, fine.  And after working with their customer service, I can tell they could care less that we are no longer a member.  Good riddance and goodbye."

1858,0,I have an item that has been recalled. I called the store and was told to bring it in and they would give me a gift card in the amount of the purchase. I got to the store after driving over an hour to my closet target to be told that they would not accept it that i had to call the manufacturer. I explained that i had called and thats why i brought it in they said it did not matter that they were no linger taking them back that they did just for a short time. It was a waste of time and gas.  No one in customer service is on the same page and it should not be the customers fault.

I am out of $234 and cannot, at this time, afford to purchase another one and I need it to work from home. I CAN'T BELIEVE this!!!

I haven't been in a target store in a while now I know why."
1449,0,"Target gave me a free promotional gift card with me order, and then I looked at my bank statement and they charged me for it. I thought it was an error so I called the customer service number and the representative said “there is a processing fee for the gift card (that’s via email) that is the same amount as the gift card. She then refused to take the “free” gift card, that they charged me for, off of my Target account and give me my money back. Basically they said the gift card was free and charged me the exact amount for the gift card, disguising it as a “processing fee.”"
1983,0,I will never do business with Target again and I advise ya'll do the same. I had called guest services on Cyber Monday to see if they price match Walmarts price. The representative said Target does do price match and reviewed the items i wanted to price match. I placed the order and i never received any information regarding the difference i price. So i called in the next day and i was told that Target doesn't do price match. I could have bought the items cheaper at walmart and missed on the deals because i wanted to go and try target. Target hasn't apologies nor accepted that they messed up.
1081,0,I have been a loyal Target customer since 2002. I paid my balance off last February and due to Covid I obviously have not been out shopping. I received notification from my credit monitoring agency that Target dropped my available credit on the card.

Unbelievable way to treat a long time good customer. I will be doing my Christmas shopping elsewhere.

2155,0,"If you are from Canada DO NOT ORDER FROM TARGET!! I bought a set of kitchen canisters. They were delivered today and the moment I picked up the box - which had been left on my front step - I knew something was broken.  The one container was smashed into a dozen pieces.  A phone call to customer service did nothing.  I was told that they don't accept international returns and even if they did I'd still have to pay for shipping.  I use many american online shopping services, including Wayfair, Macy's and Restoration Hardware and I've never once had an issue with returns, let alone with faulty merchandise.  Stay away.  I wish I had read these reviews before I'd ordered but I mistakenly believed that a big outlet like Target would know what they're doing.  So wrong."
272,0,"Sun Day morning 2/26/2023. I made a list of places I can buy Dog food. What I would like to have happen is have 10 people not shop the store for 3 months & have those 10 people get  10 more & so on do the same.we spend about 300 / month there. If I can get 10 people do the same. And have those people to do the same & so on. Math if I spend 300/ month & have 1 of those people do the same. And have the 1st 10 people do this. 300/ month from me x 10 people $3000.00 then x 10 more $30,00.00 x 10= 3,000,000. That is for 1 month x 3 month = $9,000,000.00 & have 10 more times =$90,00,00.00. You can figure the rest out.  Maybe we will get the attention. If you hit them in the pocket thats what will make changes happen. Target revenue for the twelve months ending October 31, 2022 was $108.721B, a 5.2% increase year-over-year.Target, Walmart, Pet smart, Amazon, Tractor supply & a few others. I was looking for dog food. Purina Puppy Chow with real chicken not the flavor type & Pedigree Dog chow. Listed the items on a spreadsheet. Went ordered it from the Lanham, Md. store. Okay received an email sayin the order should be ready for pick up within 2 to 3 hrs. Got an email saying it was ready. Took a picture of the order # then a picture of a bar code. Went to the store to pick it up. They bring out 1 item. I asked what happened to the other item. So here is a picture of the order details. So I didn't pick it up & stated I will be back in a few minutes. Went home then there was another email. 1 said pick up @ Lanham the other said pick up @ Hyattsville store. Both had the same order Number # 2 different stores. So I called service customer # get set to another place that is giving away  a free something. I said I am not interested in that I want to talk yo customer service Hung Up. I was still on line went to chat. Gave the Info to the chat. They say there was only 1 item on the number. Copied & pasted the whole order. I aske if they could switch the ore=der to the same store. I was told that I would Have to cancel the order & reorder. So I did. It came up not sold * this store any more. What the @#@#. Went back to the store & asked to speak to the General Manager. The lady said she was. I scratched my head & said. When I 1st got here someone was helping you on the same register with somethin else & your A general Manager. All i all if you read this I stated I will never shop this store again. What I would like to have happen is have 10 people not shop the store for 3 months & have those 10 people get  10 more & so on do the same."
1351,0,"Target used to be the best. The only issue I had there was going in for 2 things, and walking out with 25. lol The last few times, well before Covid, that I went in there I couldn't find what I was looking for, AND didn't find anything extra to buy. That was super weird to me. I have purchased work clothes there several times, and always found their items to be cute and decently made. That ship has sailed, too. Either I have to dress like I'm 25 or 75, and the quality has drastically deteriorated. But their debit card and horrendous customer service, is why I'm here. I took advantage of their debit card linked to my bank account. I did all of my shopping, including grocery, there for several years. I never had an issue with that card. Well, through a system glitch with our direct deposits, my paycheck didn't go through on time. Now, if you're unfamiliar with this card, you get a percentage off when you use it, the charge comes right out of your bank account, and it doesn't come out of your account for a couple of days after you've shopped. Honestly, that can help out a lot when you're living paycheck to paycheck. I took advantage of that, but never once was a payment declined until this one time. I made $247.63 in purchases on the SAME DAY my deposit hit...or was supposed to. I had no idea at the time there was an issue; not until the next morning. First, I had to resolve the deposit issue so all of my payments wouldn't bounce. Then I went to call Target, but holy smokes, they had already CANCELLED MY CARD. After 4 years and several thousands of dollars spent there, one issue occurs and they chuck me within 24 hours.I explained the situation and even offered to pay the entire amount PLUS A FEE to make this account right and get my card back. Nope. Representative was beyond rude and treated me like a criminal. I'm sorry you hate your life, ma'am, but that is not my fault.It's just as well, because other stores have been more than happy to take my money, and I have survived quite well without Target."

1346,0,On 5 July I ordered a gift for my son’s 5th birthday which was the 9th of July.  When I placed the order and the reason I settled on this order was because the delivery date was the 8th of July. This would have been the day before my sons birthday. On the 8th the package was not delivered. I then went to the email sent by Target to track the package and the delivery date has been changed to July 10th. This was disappointing to say the least. So I explained to a 5 year old why his dad didn’t get him anything for his birthday. I also explained that the gift would be here in two days and since then with excitement everyday he inquired as to when it would arrive. On the 9th I told him tomorrow and the morning of the 10th I assured him that it would be here today. After work I rushed to pick up my son and we rushed home expecting to see his gift. To both of our disappointments it was not delivered. Again I tracked the packed and it said that it had been delivered to Fedex in Kernersville which is 10 miles from my house at 5:44 am. Yet more than 12 hours later I still don’t have my child’s gift. This experience has convinced me to never purchase anything from Target.com. When I called their customer service line I received no assistance and the gentleman on the phone who identified himself as Jay constantly interrupted me and only offered to issue me a refund. A refund does not change the fact that I had lied to and disappointed my child. I requested to speak to a supervisor and after being placed on hold was told that one would call me. It is now the morning of the 11th and I am still waiting on that call. I must say On 5 July I ordered a gift for my son’s 5th birthday which was the 9th of July. My order number is 9067022960294. When I placed the order and the reason I settled on this order was because the delivery date was the 8th of July. This would have been the day before my sons birthday.

It is now the morning of the 11th and I am still waiting on that call. I must say the entire experience with target has been regrettable and disappointing.  This company apparently does not care for it’s customers. Expectations set for the customer should be met. The company has an obligation to its customers and Target failed to meet any of them in this shopping experience.   My entire experience with target has been regrettable and disappointing.

1992,0,"7 days after online order, items still have not arrived, despite Fedex showing items as delivered. Target customer service is claiming Fedex markes orders as delivered before doing so.Sketchy experience. We're still being told to wait a few more days.Target, if you have problems with Fedex, how about go fix it with Fedex instead of having your customers wait around after they've already been told that the their items have been delivered? Spoiler alert: we don't pay to stay on the phone for hours and follow up on deliveries Fedex marked as delivered."

It was a large order and arrived in 3 boxes, none of which had much packing material…one had nothing, one had a plastic bag and one had the products zip tied together that broke during shipping and a too small air pillow in there, the products were thrown all around and arrived damaged. The products all leaked or arrived with broken and smashed lids."

Kohl’s is a messy pile of stuff which makes no sense. Guess what, now that our local Target has changed up the store layout IT’S JUST LIKE KOHLS! It now has “areas” not aisles. I am a long-time shopper and everyone agreed with me that they lived Target because it made simple sense. Now, like Kohl’s, it is SENSORY OVERLOAD. I am no longer loyal or attracted, Target."

567,0,"One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. I used to love target, specially for the clothing section, but that’s it, the only good thing target has is the clothing and even that sometimes is poor quality. I called today to ask couple stuff to the customer service department and also the HR department, the way they answer was “HELLO” screaming and in a very rude tone, no good morning, good evening, or maybe “hello, how can I help you”. Red flag right away. Then I asked if I was talking with the right department since I thought it might of been a mistake, the guy in the phone didn’t answer when I asked if it was the HR department but just screamed to this other person and said “the phone, answer her, idk just answer” and when this woman took the phone said “hello call tomorrow”; I was shocked, I said “at what time?” And she just said “I don’t know, whenever, bye” and hang up on me. I’ve never experienced such a terrible customer service. If I could give a negative 10 stars I would."

Also, according to the FedEx driver the package was signed by H HENRY.

I lost the money.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE CROOKS!"
430,2,"So I was the Loveland target with 6 packages of pens & I had a coupon for each item. The coupons wouldn't scan so I called over the self check cashier to have her manual punch them in. She takes her sweet time looking over the coupons & only allows him to use 4 of them. She tells me that it doesn't go with the product that I'm purchasing.  I ask for a manager & about 3-4 minutes later a so call manager comes up his name is Cisco. He doesn't come to me the customer & ask how he can help he goes to the cashier behind my back & talks as soft as possible. He comes over & looks at the 2 $1.00 coupons ask if I have the product then looks & mess around in my bag & tells me I don't have the products. I told him I did but in a bigger size. He said the coupon is for a 5 pack of pens not an 8 pack. I told him that was poor customer service & he was losing business because of this. I told him to get away from me because he was too close to me a female & I would buy Mt items & ho with my 2 sleepy kids. After he took 2-3steps away he started to talk to the cashier & they both were staring at me which then I told me to walk away because I felt uncomfortable with him. Then he wouldn't leave & I told him that's poor customer service & he said to me that ""I could leave if I wanted too"". I told him I wasn't raising my voice, not being rude & I didn't curse at them. I told Cisco that I would write a review on this & he didn't care & he didn't apologize for anything. That truly is not how you treat your customers. I was interested same store 4 nights prior asking for the same pens that I just brought tonight & found Cisco asked him if he go in the back to find them. He said he couldn't because he was short staffed & only had 4-6 employees closing that night. He said they were on a pallet somewhere on the floor & he & no one else can help me locate the pens. This guy should not be a manager he doesn't know how to talk & take care of his customers. If it wasn't for us the customers he & his staff wouldn't have a job. This is unacceptable behavior especially for a so call manager!!"

Went back number of times to store, found out they actually gave me wrong prescription on them , got new still can’t see. Contacted customer care no help . So I spent 200.00 can’t use glasses ( live in Florida) . Store said I guess I loose. It didn’t help with covid shutting down store for awhile. So buyers beware ."
825,0,I'd give zero stars if I could.   I ordered an air fryer that came in an opened box with no packing materials or info booklet user instructions.  It was like someone tossed it in a box used scotch tape to close the box and mailed it.    Months later I ordered bedding for my grandson that arrived ripped and torn without packaging and Target wanted to be jerks in the store about returning it.  TARGET HAS GOTTEN THE LAST OF MY MONEY.

I asked to speak to a manager. I was told it would be a 32 minute hold. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Shame on you Target and your horrible customer service."

You are there to help customers not ignore them and make faces at them. I wasn’t the only one who had a problem with her. I met a nice couple who tried talking to her And asked for help but she just stared at them and ignored them, luckily another employee stepped in and helped.

0,0,"Website doesn't work properly using Google Chrome OR Firefox.  Not sure what they did, but it is ridiculous.Had to use my cell phone's browser.  It is NOT a cache clearing issue.  It has something to do with computers not using Windows 10 or higher.Obviously Target's IT Website Dept has incompetently changed components and/or protocols which block a good number of customers from continuing to use the website.Pages show swirling icons; notice at bottom says api.target working; can't get the webpage to load completely AND if by some miracle it does, then it won't allow the Customer to Check Out.Target really needs to get their act together.  Not everyone wants to use their App, which is painful to navigate.  Especially for older or non-tech saavy people."
313,0,"Beware of Target Gift Cards!  Following is my most recent experience dealing with a gift card that did not work. I purchased 2 Target Gift Cards at a local Target store here in Oceanside, CA on 12/21/22.  One worked ($100.00) and the attached ($50.00) did not.  I went back to the store of purchase yesterday, 1/05/23, to have the card replaced, only to be told that the store would not do this and I had to go thru the 800 number.  I purchased these cards in good faith.  There is no mention of Target's policy on the card or on the receipt.  I can somewhat understand this position when a gift card is purchased from an outside source, but this is incomprehensible when the transaction takes place in one of the Target stores.  It took 3 phone calls (disconnected 1st call and hung up on by representative during 2nd call) before I reached someone who sent me the information needed to file the claim.I have jumped thru all their hoops required to get this issue resolved. Currently waiting for their response."

Went to store to make purchase, stay in line, expecting to be happy, but card was declined. After cashiers made suggestion that the card expired or fake called to number on the back of card. Holding line, feel embarrassed as hell I got respond that card number is ""not recognized"". Cashier tried to do same through her phone....same thing. I ended up to pay my own money. A few days later person who purchased the card did same thing called to number on back of the card got 3 different businesses, called 3 more times and got answer ""card is active"", ""balance is available"". Great now i feel embarrassed again! People have your own money with you when you shop with the card.P'S' Target did not posted my review on actual product saying ""your review not posted as there inappropriate image or language"". I copy and paste my review as is wondering what is ""inappropriate""  they trying to sell even more gift cards like that and charge $8.50? Also why to post my review i should provide my personal information. Now I should expect repercussions for my report on Target bad business?"

2457,0,"As a loyal Target customer I am extremely disappointed!! I placed an online order for an item that was in stock when I placed my order, completed all my check out process, money was taken out of my bank, and later, my order was cancelled by Target. I could have bought this item elsewhere for the same price but I chose Target because I am your loyal customer. Target cancelled my order when i can no longer get it anywhere else. I spoke with two customer service agents who have offered no resolution to help, and have basically told me for lack of better words oh well. Also they explained to me that even if i completed check out process, it’s their right to cancelled my order at their will. This is unacceptable to me, I cannot believe this is how Target treats their patrons, especially one that spends as much as I do at your store on a regular basis. This was a christmas gift for my mother , and now I am at a complete loss. I have always held Target to a higher standard, especially when it comes to customer service, which is way I spend my money there as oppose to other big box stores. Well after this experience I can no longer say that, and will be taking all my purchases elsewhere. Target, you didn’t just loose 1 customers but you lost all of the people i know. I will surely let them know about this experience."
2557,0,"Very frustrated with Target customer service.  Ordered a bed on 7/7, given delivery date of 7/19.  Every day the shipping company tells me it'll be the next day and never shows up.  I've tried calling customer service and they told me there's nothing they can do and just believe  what the shipping company says.  Why does your customer service side with the shipping company and not the CUSTOMER!!!"
2292,0,"I am specifically writing about Target, South Brunswick store in New Jersey. The cashiers are the most ill mannered and lack common courtesy, forget providing a good customer experience. They are racist and will not even acknowledge by a simple hello, if you are an Asian or an Indian. And this is a pattern that I have noticed, across the board. They are rude and should not be in their position."

1085,0,I saw there is a diaper deal buy 100get 20gc，also I chose same day delivery service but I ordered at night.No one deliver the package at night I understand，I get them next day. Then，I can not get my gift card because they say that's not same day service.And the price of the items in the order were changed totally.Why target system is so poor？if cant do same day delivery，you should stop receive same day order at nighttime.I have to return all the items because I didnt get any discount and gc.
425,0,I ordered online but the size shirt I ordered was the wrong size so I contact customer service online and ask them to see if I can get a different size. So the person I talked to tell they can’t do it so then he tell me to place a new order and I did then the order was canceled then he transferred me to someone else then they tell me I can’t place a new till 24 hour. You should have told me that before I canceled the order then they tell me sorry I really wish I could help you. That is the worst customer service on the planet
2320,0,I rarely complain online but this was a terrible experience ordering a piece of furniture from Target.com. I was helping my brother give his house a facelift while he was recovering from heart surgery. It took 10 days to arrive and 2 of the main pieces were broken in half in two different places. I called customer service and they ordered me two replacement parts that also took 10 days to arrive. They shipped me two of the same pieces instead of the two different pieces do I was back at square one. Target said because they ordered It correctly I would have to take pictures to prove I got 2 of the same piece. It would take up to 10 more days to get the one piece after it was approved. They said Target wasn’t responsible. It was the manufacturers issue even though I bought this all from Target.com. I’m done and returning the whole thing.  I’ll never purchase online from Target again.
1816,0,"First time I saw the honey pot commercial I thought how racist! Ya know if it was a white person saying this gives other WHITE girls hope for the future or whatever the exact wording was, their would be an uproar.... No I take that back because it wouldn't happen in the first place! It would not be allowed. So Target take your racist honey pot branding along with the maker who thinks its ok to make such racist remarks in a commercial, and shove it! I certainly won't be purchasing any products from target or from the racist company."
2112,0,The worst do not EVER EVER use the baby registry at Target I purchased things from the registry took paper to cashier as was told about an hour later I looked same things I purchased and other guest purchased were still on registry. I called target spoke to a few agents then Denise a  supervisor she inform me to call my guest and ask them what  purchased. WHAT!!!!! why would I call ppl and asked what they purchased my daughter I thought that is what a registry is for so ppl won’t buy the same thing. Then she informs me to bring things back for return. Lady again what is the registry for. Do I want to haul all that stuff back and I live 30min from Target. And the ONLY thing they can say is I’m sorry well yes y’all are

I only tried to order 3 items but it automatically became 5 items and exiting out and attempting a second and third time only resulted in the number of items increasing to 8 items. I finally had to call the number listed to place the order and get a confirmation. Then when I attempted to leave a comment on the Traget.com website I was unable to do so and had to go to this site to leave a comment. This cannot be defined as ""good customer relations""."
205,0,This store is the WORST!!!! They are selling children’s clothing that is sexual in content. What is wrong with them!!! These are innocent precious children that are being subjected to sexually oriented clothing if a person chooses to shop there. Well I’m done with this store!! You disgust me. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH LET OUR CHILDREN BE CHILDREN!!!!! I only gave it a one star because I had to so I could post this review.

In the women's section right now, for example, they have huge photos of women models with a man with earrings and a feminine look who is probably supposed to represent someone non binary or gender fluid. Why? And don't get me started on Pride month and targeting BABIES with the pride clothing, etc."

2047,0,I made an online order... had to pick up at 3 different Targets. I am aware they hold the authorized amount until your items are picked up. However I wasn’t aware at each store they also charge for the item. So now the balance of order is pending as well as each individual item. I don’t see how this is legal. After contacting Target I was reassured the authorized amount will drop off. Well it still hasn’t... Target is a double dipping company. Beware and check your bank accounts. Who knows how many times this happens. So crooked!

Target has NOT stopped their selling of the line of clothes and what not is in question. Everything is still in Targets inventory. I am researching other stores that are doing the same thing although they may not be advertising as so. I drew the line when i saw the life-size statue of Baphomet! With a full ensemble on! Boycott the crap out of these stores, stuff just isn't that important."
786,0,"This is not the first time I did an online order for store pickup but yet again it is a waste of time. I won’t be ordering online from Target again. I have done similar online orders for store pickup at Walmart.com, very efficient and no issue. I placed an order for a JBL Clip 4 speaker the night prior to be picked up at the nearby Target, website indicated the store had 2 more in stock. No email notifying for pickup at 10:30am, so I logged on to the account to check. It indicated out of stock at the store and so I clicked on other options and selected a store 8 miles away that had it in stock. Got an email back in an hour saying that my order has been cancelled because the item is out of stock. It is so frustrating! I could have ordered thru Amazon and would have gotten my item today (plus a free case) at the same price. So I just logged on to Amazon and bought the exact speaker online at the exact price and it will be delivered tomorrow for free. I could have picked the free 4am-8am overnight delivery for free as well but I decided it is not that urgent. So Target, you have lost me for your online business. I love to shop at Target for groceries but your online order for store collection is really poor in today’s market."
1837,0,"On Dec. 3, I placed an online order at Target.com for two $100 digital gift cards during the 10% off sale, one to be sent to my phone number and one to my wife’s. Mine arrived; hers never did. I called customer service. After a 27-minute wait, I was told that it could not be resent to her [no explanation as to why – and that seems totally bogus] and would have to be sent to me. But I was told that my current card had to be erased and two new ones sent. The cards both appeared in Target app wallet. So, even though upset that I would have to be on every trip to Target for us to use the gift cards, I thought my problem was solved. In a few days I received an alert from my credit card bank that a $90 charge at Target was made on my credit card. I had bought nothing at Target. I called the credit card company to say I had not made the charge and perhaps someone had made a fraudulent charge. When I told them that I had made $180 purchase in December, we decided to wait to cancel my credit card and call Target. Again a 15-minute wait for customer service, and I was told it was a mistake and would not move from pending to a real charge. That did not solve the problem! This charge happened once a week ever since. I get an alert and see a $90 charge from Target. Last week I saw that it had moved into a real charge. I called customer service. A 10-minute wait and the very nice young man told me it was an error that kept happening and not to worry about it. Really?? I told him I wanted it fixed so I did not have to keep checking my credit card and wasting time. He said “This is a Target problem. I cannot fix it.” I said, “So you do not really work for Target?” He said “no” and gave me an email address and said I had to write directly – another waste of my time. I wrote and in three days got a response saying they were having trouble and needed to keep charging until it cleared. This is a credit card I have no problems with. Yesterday I received a text from Target saying they were canceling the gift card because they could not make the charge work. I was given to option to try another credit card. I spent hours on this issue and never once received an apology or a solution from Target. Very disappointing."

(Luckily, I added my phone to the order and a person from the company called me and let me know the package had arrived there).  Still waiting for the rest of the order as it was split in 5 deliveries.  Terrible costumer service over the phone. They just repeat a script but no solution is given."
1804,0,"I bought an oyster fondue machine online from the target on cicero and 31st since it was in stock. I went to go pick it up and of course it was already bagged up. I was planning on using it today 2/14 at 230pm with my family as we have been planning for about a week. I open the package and 1. There is tape all over it and 2. There is no CORD to plug it in the wall. This is an electronic fondue machine! My family is super unhappy and obviously now so am I. So i call the target, speak to the manager whom was nice, and got transferred to the customer service desk who didn't seem to have an interest in what i was saying. So now im sitting here with no working fondue machine and don't want to go return it today as we planned on staying in today. This was a waste of time, money and im not happy. When things get re- ticketed they should be thoroughly checked for all pieces."

I was told to just reorder my product again online. I used a 20% off coupon which made the price lower than when originally purchased. Recieved my item, it was wrong, again. Went online to chat with a representative, who looked up my order and without hesitation placed a replacement order for me. I will be recieving the correct item in two day. Thank you target for making my holiday shopping stress free and for the amazing customer service!"
2370,0,"Target has gotten so bad with their customer service, with what they stock and the appearance of their managers. This was the last time I deal with them. It's just one thing after another. Trying to buy a crib and a mattress online to pickup at the store and they said their is no way to ship it to the store for pickup!! Horrible customer service! Buy Buy Baby got my business. Target going downhill fast!"
2038,0,"Realized when I got home what price was completely different than one on the app. Talked to customer service and had to send screen shots and pic of item as we politely argued about price match to own app. $89.99 versus the $112.49 I paid. The lady on phone kept telling me that I didn't purchase the item I say I did. I informed her there was proof in the pics she requested and already saw. I was on hold for a long time. During that hold I had reloaded the very heavy item and planned to tell her to ""never mind"" that I wold return the item to the store. When she came back on the line, she told me to take item back to the store because she couldn't help me. So for once the customer service lady on the phone and I were on the same page.I am very glad that I took the item back to the store. At the store,I was informed that the orange stickers on heavy items frequently have wrong numbers. Further, glad I took it back to the store because not only did pay $112.49 for an item that the app said was $89.99 (a difference of 22.50) ,but found out that the $89.99 wasn’t the sale price. So after having to load and unload 4 times I got back $45- a HUGE difference! And a HUGE inconvenience!!This coupled with another recent experience where the app lists an item $7 cheaper than purchased at the store. Had I let the store clerk get the item off the shelf for me I would have saved money. Silly me- I did the work myself which cost me more money. Makes no sense!!"
858,0,"TARGET IS ADVERTISING THAT THEY WANT PRODUCTS FOR BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES. ONLY BLACK OWNED. NOT IRISH. NOT JAPANESE. NOT SPANISH. NOT GERMAN. NOT ITALIAN. NOT VIETNAMESE. JUST BLACK. PANDERING TO ONE GROUP IS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE OTHERS. TARGET ONLY WANTS EARNINGS FROM 13% OF THE POPULATION AND IS NOT INTERESTED IN ANYONE ELSES BUSINESS. APPARENTLY YOUR MONEY IS THE WRONG COLOR. DO NOT SHOP AT CRAZED BUSINESSES THAT PUSH RACIAL HATRED AND DISCRIMINATION PROPAGANDA. FOR THE WEAK MINDS. IMAGINE THEIR COMMERCIALS SAID THEY ONLT CARE ABOUT WHITE BUSINESS? END OF THE WORLD. AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE THEM GO THE WAY OF WOKA COLA. ONLY DO BUSINESS WITH COMPANIES THAT APPRECIATE ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS INSTEAD OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM. TARGET IS KNOWINGLY RACIST AND DESPISES WHITES, ASIANS, AND LATINOS. WE WILL TAKE AWAY OUR MONEY. THANK YOU FOR ADMITTING YOU ARE RACISTS."
2390,0,"I used Target's online service for store pickup & used my $20 Gift card online. Order # 1022107047269Picked up my order at 10.35 AM today via the pickup area. The customer service representative stated that the Gift card was applied to the bill. IT WAS NOT! (I only noticed after leaving the store), so I spent 10 minutes of waiting on hold to get this number 1-800-440-0680 & waiting another 20 mins for a human to help resolve the issue. To be honest, I don't like leaving negative reviews, I gave them a chance to try & fix the issue but I don't think they really care. I tried reaching Target, now they can reach out to me to resolve this issue.The fact of the matter is that they did not honor the $20 Gift card even after verbally stating it & now since the Gift card was used online, it is no longer valid. So basically, scamming a customer out of $20 = to a 1-star review. If I could give 0 stars, I would!"

Going to checkout I attempted to use a NetSpend card, I was quickly informed that Target online would not accept prepaid cards for payment. Ok I don't understand but whatever so I switched payment to my Chime card and payment was processed. I received a notification from my NetSpend account that 2, not 1 but 2 holds of the purchase amount were still pending from my prepaid account that Target does not accept. Ok so 1 of holds has been released, as for the other, no. I have already received the ball pit which was paid for from my Chime account, I have sent several e mails to Target that I want the hold released from my money!!!!! If you don't even take prepaid cards for payment then how are you able to hold MY OWN MONEY HOSTAGE like this?!?!?!! As of over a week later I am STILL waiting for them to release hold of my money that wasn't even supposed to be used for this transaction! I don't know what to do next except to sue Target for theft and unlawful hold on monies never agreed to. Total bad experience with Target and I never want to shop with them again!"

Now onto the fun part of this review. You can only buy one pack of cards at one time? Really? What kind of idiotic policy is that. One pack of Pokemon cards that's worth $4 and you're letting customers only get one? Thats absolutely the most ridiculous policy I've ever heard in my life. If you're trying to stop people from reselling them, that's ridiculous because WOW its worth maybe $10 resold. OMG WOW YOU GUYS ARE SO COOL. Go away target or get better policies. At least let people buy 3 packs."
1091,0,"Not everyone has a nearby Target store, which is why we order online.  But now Target has decided to no longer deliver most items to my zip code because they can't make enough money sending to areas where there is less demand.  The fact that we don't live in urban areas is specifically why we need orders shipped to our zip code.  That's not right.  Bad customer service, plain and simple.  You're giving your business away to Walmart and Amazon, and I hope it comes back to bite you."

1615,0,Honey pot is NOT specifically made for BLACK WOMEN. The bottle literally says: Made by humans with vaginas FOR humans with Vaginas. So 1. Black ppl leaving reviews stop thinking it's made for us. It's not. It's a black owned company. 2. How are they not inclusive? Any HUMAN with a va jay jay can use it. Y'all really don't care about Humans because y'all wouldn't even be crying racism. A black woman wanting black lil girls to be confident is racist?  Do y'all even use your heads? You're projecting your racism. White people can not be victims of racism. We are oppressing you.. We literally DON'T have the power to. So stop it and grow up. Every thing has veen geared around you. Y'all want every one to be inclusive to you but don't want people in your safe spaces. I bet y'all don't think you're Being racist.Now to the HONEY POT review. Though it's hard to find Inreally like how I feel using it. I actually prefer the sensitive skin wash because the regular one kind of irritates But I really don't have complaints. Shout out to Target for giving EVERYONE a platform. Not just white ppl you know.

534,0,"Target is okay but... it has room for improvement. The good with Target is that they have great diaper deals, good beauty capsules, and the once a year 10% giftcard sale. However, it has some drawbacks. First, they charge you more online than it does for in-store - this is why I usually will buy on Walmart that does not upcharge you. Second, their items are usually more expensive than on Walmart and Amazon. Third, their in-store pickup experience isn't as fast as Walmart's and they don't have a call option like Walmart does. For these reasons, I shop on Walmart and Amazon much more than I do with Target, with the exceptions of several categories that Target usually beats out in pricing (diapers) or exclusive items (like the beauty capsules). Overall, Target is still okay and I buy things there (5%), but most of my spending is done with Walmart (75%), then Amazon (20%)."
2555,0,I made a purchase on tagets online store. I have been a loyal customer and card holder for a long time and they sent me something other than what I bought they then said they would send my correct item. I waited 2 months and they kept sending me emails saying I had to re confirm the delay until finally I missed one email after 2 months. They then sent me a email saying I would not receive the item because I missed that email. Turns out they did not really have the item instock and maid the decision to not tell me that they where never really sending it. I talked to them and found online a package that has the item in it I was supposed to receive and its about the same price. They decided if I want it I can give them $15 more dollars (purchase it again) I am shocked this is something a con man would do. why would I give you more money for what I had already bought and never received 2 months ago. Really wish I could upload a picture of the conversation on here.

This year hooking it up, only the bottom section would lite. I contacted BCP, they told me to contact Target. Target would not refund it, told me to contact BCP even though tree was purchased with Target. Target use to have a great return policy, believe it was 1 year.  60 days in nothing for a Christmas tree that is used once per year.  Target needs to either stand behind their products they sell or get reputable suppliers that will honor their product.  $300 for a one time use artificial tree is non- sense.  Be leery buying any trees from Target."

1194,0,As a former employee of target when they first came to Southern California I still see some room for improvement. The ordering process limits the quantity of items in store.  It would help to be able to place order while at store.  Or at least give option of picking up at next closest location.

2191,0,"Warning- Never try to return an item without a receipt. You’re offered less than a fourth of the value of the item. You are not given the option of a store gift card, heaven forbid! I tried to return a birthday gift which was unopened and within 30 days. The given had paid $90 for the item, along with $10 for a required accessory item. I was told that I would only receive $26 back. This was after checking the item and being told that it was a gift. When asked why, I was told that it was to protect the manufacturing company. In other words, forget about stealing from the customer! I was appalled and will not be purchasing anything from Target unless it’s an immediate consumable.This is a horrible return policy! I had to ask the giver for the receipt & luckily it was found. Money could not be returned to the credit card, because I did not have it! How utterly absurd is that?

394,0,"Ordered two needed items online, for store pickup. Everything on site stated 'ready within two hours'. After over two hours with no order update, we travelled to store. Service Desk & Management blamed excessive orders; acted like all customers should magically know the store's order volume at any given time; were not at all willing to work with us. We physically brought my two items (there was only one left of one of the items) to the desk, repeatedly pleading for cooperation so i could leave with my items. They would not allow. Staff was not very understanding, empathetic, polite, nor at all helpful. (One Desk employee was fine, but not at all empowered to address the situation, so we were passed off to others who were not as pleasant). While waiting, another customer was allowed to physically *exchange* an item for a different item -- yet i had previously not been allowed to exchange for the same item. When i had received an item shipped, it was defective; when i brought it in to exchange for the exact item in store, i had to process as a *return* and *new purchase*. This delayed the funds returning to my account; i was charged extra because my order (already paid for) then was not eligible for free shipping. The customer we observed was exchanging for a different size. One of the several excuses we were given for not being able to walk out with the items i had ordered, paid for, and fulfilled, was 'inventory' -- but that apparently was not an issue for the perceived white woman next to us. Despite our offering solutions, suggestions, and compromises to all of their excuses, they would not even consider and were not really listening. ""within 2 hours"" has turned into two days, with still no merchandise, no refund, no text, no call, no email (all contact information on file with Target account). Horrible experience, from the store employees and website -- the company site should not claim such order fulfilment timeframe if it is not expected in real life. There were no warnings at all that order volume might be high, nor higher than their capacity to handle. Absurd."
2101,0,"I was unable to purchase a prepaid phone card with my gift card. This was not disclosed in the product description so I found out at the checkout when it was too late. Now am stuck with the useless gift card.  I am very disappointed in Target and will never shop there again. At the University Heights OH location, indoor parking spaces are reminiscent of some Halloween scenes. Dark and poor visibility when trying to pull out of your parking space. An accident waiting to happen.  Not that Target cares one bit. At Skokie IL location most items are available online only, and the cashiers will send you to the wrong aisles upon request.  A nightmare. These cashiers need a REAL training that Target obviously does not provide. Besides, Target does not carry wide width shoes, despite their rubber stamp replies on social media.  Time to move on to the better places.  Spare yourself some aggravation and shop elsewhere. I do not recommend Target shopping."

As well as Target is no longer mailing coupon books.  I feel that Target is no longer meeting the needs of a diverse community...not everyone has smartphones to download Target apps or are tech savvy.  As for the ethnic foods we are not being provided  for...im beginning to feel discriminated as well not valued as a customer."

1197,0,"We recently purchased phones and and a new phone plan through Target and AT&T. Simply put, we were lied to by the AT&T rep. in the Target store. We were told, after the fact, that the whole deal was contingent on our old phones being eligible for trade in. We had to go back to Target and show them our phones. They then determined that one of the phones was not eligible, one of the phones was eligible and one probably was eligible. Now, a month down the road, it is determined that all three phones are not eligible and we are on the hook for $3,000! This 3K would be added to our bill so instead of $120/month now its about $200/month.We were not told of this extremely important contingency, we were lied to by the AT&T rep. that at least 1 phone was eligible and we can't believe that Target would be involved in predatory sales practices by AT&T within their store.DO Not Take the AT&T deal through Target!! We are currently trying to cancel the deal and if we can't, we will be pursuing legal action."

They changed their app so now when I go in and see that there is a sale if you use the app and go to wallet, it’s no where to be found. Another customer and myself attempted to find the sale in the app like advertised and neither of us could find it. I went in today and now you have to press on the keypad if you are using a rewards card regardless of how you are paying. I told the associate that I was paying cash. She responded with “fine I will press it for you.” Not that it’s a huge inconvenience to press a button, but really? So I’m  paying cash but now I feel line a moron when I respond with, no I don’t have nor want a rewards card and am unaware that suddenly you have to do an extra step regardless of your payment method.

(The employee at the customer service desk was kind and helpful though). The employee on the self checkout demonstrated poor interpersonal skills and poor customer service. Overall Target needs to better about sales tags being accurate,  updated, and legit so to not waste customer’s time regarding decisions about what items they will purchase and to find the item is full price at the register! It’s annoying to get to the checkout to find you are being charged more than what you expected! And don’t let me start about the way they dish out the advertised gift cards! All I can say is “Hocus Pocus!” Wow! Way to reel in the $$$ in a slimy fashion!"

2475,0,"I used to love target, but the love is most definitely gone. I may still shop in their store but I will NEVER buy anything online again.  After moving across the country, I had something delivered accidentally to an old address. I shop online all the time and over the course of seven months, this happened only twice. Both relatively small purchases (less than $100). The first time it was w/ DSW and it was so simple. A five minute phone call w /an awesome customer service agent and everything was fixed and my sandals were on their way to my new address.  Oh, not so with Target.  A hour later, after being hung up on once, given all sorts of completely unintelligible explanations, I am still not sure exactly what has happened.  I think I've received a partial refund, and may get another refund (?) after the second part of the order is delivered to the wrong address.  Maybe not, though, because we'll have to create a ""case number.""  Maybe, but I cannot get a straight answer and they will not or cannot (??) send me my items at the correct address. They cannot resolve the issue.  They just want to give me a case number so I can call back and be on hold for god only knows how  long again in the future.  Now, if this were a large purchase, I would totally understand, but we're talking less than 50 bucks.  How much of an ""investigation"" into this do we need to conduct Target?  No thanks.  I realized this is my fault (I changed my local store, but not my mailing address), so I am okay with having to reorder these items myself.  I would even be okay just eating the money, honestly. These phone calls with customer service, though, have pretty much left me unwilling to ever set foot in a target store or shop with them online again.  Thank goodness I didn't buy anything expensive.  I'll just consider this an $88 lesson learned and make my online purchases other places.  I don't care if I ever see my money or my items at this point.  Bravo DSW!  Boo, Target."

1370,0,"Target 32828 Waterford lakes plaza always been nasty to me because of using coupons I have to wear decent clothes alway so they don't send the security to fellow me thinking I'm going to steal .Kara ,indian manager and couple of employees are so nasty 😤 she asked me to show my digital coupons so she can verify my coupons after the system verified them. There is a white lady behind me she inserted the coupons without asking and she got thanked by the cashier while she was targeting me .Cashier forgot her employment slip and I gave it back to her ,that was showing how I'm honest and still was rude to me I dont think target care about customers anyway"
1411,0,"Thanks Target. I have never had any issue with anything at Target and I’ve shopped at Target for over 20 years and in several different states. I use order pick up, order online and ship it to another state and I have never had any problems. You may be short on cleaning supplies and paper products, but, so is everyone else. I completely understand that the people who make these products have been ordered to stay at home just like the rest of us and it is going to take along time for things to get built back up, these companies have a lot of ground to cover And I’m sure that when they get back to work they will do their best just like the rest of us. Keep up the good work and know that Target is my happy place."
1582,0,"Placed a small order for same day delivery. Everything was fine till the charge hit my card. No weighted items and no substitutions. Final bill was way higher than the original total. Tried to contact Customer Service. Two hours and nine reps later I still did not have an answer. One agent tells me they can't help I have to call a number, the second tells me they are transferring to the correct party and nothing happens, third tells me there's a shipping charge on top of the shipping charge in the total of the order (what??) and when the stupidity of that statement was pointed out, I was told to dispute it and chat was terminated. I have seen incompetent (Amazon, eBay, Walmart are all fine examples) but Target takes the gold medal of incompetent customer service. None of the nine people I talked to had a clue what to do. We give this business our personal information and credit card numbers?? It was an attempt to avoid stores during this virus scare but next time I am risking it. Corona is nothing compared to this painful experience! I rather risk exposure to a potentially deadly virus than deal with Target again. It's that bad!"

The customer service people at Target.com were not helpful.  They kept saying ""wait another two business days.""  I called after waiting the time they said to (although I needed the items and had to go out and buy them elsewhere).  They never offered to send me the items expedited after the original ones did not arrive.  I will not use target.com again."

804,0,"HORRIBLE experience with Target and their logistic's company EFW!! Ordered a kitchen island on June 6th, received notification from EFW that the item was received and confirmed delivery date out for delivery on June 15th. Crickets, got nothing! Attempted to contact EFW on several occasions using their CHAT online service, chats were ended abruptly, no one could locate my item. Fine, the original scheduled delivery was June 23rd, I will wait for that day. Well here we are, no delivery, called Target and they confirmed with EFW they cannot locate my product. Wait what? EFW you knew you ""lost"" my product 1 week ago for whatever reason you failed to notify me. This is why AMAZON is kicking your butt TARGET! You can have your lousy $20 gift card for the inconvenience, not ever shopping with you again."
1102,0,"At first target was doing fine. I ordered online, received proper confirmations and received the correct items in a timely manner. But the last time they did not do well at all. For one, items come separately which is a little annoying but not a deal breaker as long as I get everything but this time I only received two of the three packages waiting on the most important one which never came because it was returned to target. But they kept sending me emails like I would still receive the package. I did not because they had it and you can't reorder those items unless you go through the whole ordering process again having to spend at least $35. The customer service claim some were only available for pickup. And also I called their CS and the representative acted slow like she did not understand anything I was saying just repeating the same thing like an idiot and so did the chat line agent. They were useless. It's not the only issue I had with ordering online but the other things again we're not deal breakers but this was. Lastly after they emailed me telling me my package was returned to them, they still sent an email days later saying it had been delivered to me (a lie). So I don't know what happened but they screwed up and didn't even explain what happened but they did give my money back kind of quickly."
1818,0,"You know how fast things roll through your mind even within just a matter of a few seconds? When the honey pot commercial started, I thought how cool it was that Target  would give a small business; maybe something she created in her home, such a GREAT opportunity. But then, the comment she made regarding helping the next black girl......stunned. So disappointing."
2041,0,"I shop at target all the time and I LOVE them, I ordered online using my 25% off toy coupon and they canceled my order for whatever reason and I called to figure it out and the person who I spoke to couldn’t understand anything I was saying, didn’t help me at all, wasn’t listening to my concerns at all and stressed me out more than anything and I got NOWHERE with them. Extremely disappointed and made me not want to shop there again."
656,2,"Target customer service is horrendous Ordered items that were fragile and shipped without any insulation and completely broken Had to return via ups before they would resend - guess what!!!!. broken again in a box with our packaging after customer service indicated they placed a note to packaging .Recalled Customer service that then said they could refund but cannot be reordered .No other option - that’s it’s - sorry for your inconvenience - no solution , no resolution good luck next time -"
399,0,I live in Naples and was out of town visiting family when my item from Target was delivered. I planned out exchanging the color when I got back to Naples. The color I wanted was out of stock. We were in Ga. when we learned of the hurricane so we stayed. We live 1 Mike firm the beach and our neighbors homes were destroyed. Once I got back to Naples I tried to exchange my item and was told I was a few days too late to exchange. I could not drive back during the hurricane to make the deadline. They refuse to do anything. This has to be the worse customer service I’ve seen. I will never shop from there and hoping my neighbors take that into consideration when thinking of shopping there. So many companies helping us out here and Target does this. Shame on them!!!
28,0,"I dialed 1800-440-0680  which is your toll free number to customer service. The young man  who took my call told me I was rude and disrespectful,  because I told him that he was speaking on a different subject. His conversation was not regarding what I asked. He told me he was going to cancel my online order.He yelled at me and hung up on  me.I tried to call back and was placed on hold again. After 30 minutes of holding on I hung up and decided to write the review.Extreme unprofessional customer service. I have the time and date of the conversation.I would appreciate a response back regarding this rude employee."

8,0,"You have now lost a ""pick up"" in store customer!  I placed these orders on 8/9 for pick up at the Annapolis, MD location.  Within an hour after placing this order, I received emails that neither one were available.  You truly need to reconsider/revamp how you're charging customers for pick up & having their funds sitting in ""processing"" for 5 days!!!!  This has happened to me several times now & will no longer ever chance it happening again.  In turn, means that you will lose some of my business as I will go to another store that's closer to find items that I need.  I called customer service today & was asked if I wanted to cancel this order????  Seriously??   I was told the items aren't available, why wasn't this automatically cancelled?  Makes me wonder just how much money Target makes by having all our funds sitting in your account!!!Please return my money ASAP & consider making much needed necessary changes on your pick up orders & being charged before finding out if an item is truly available."

After extensive research from Zeleema, Georgetown, Guyana, who wasn't going to give up finding my order information, only to find out I entered the email wrong! I mentioned Tracking #, to which she replied, I can find your order number by tracking # (Great Active listening skill). She found order #, she found information on the missing order items, she gave me all the information on each item, and now with order number, I can track. She was efficient, she was gracious, she was professional, and she was simply wonderful to communicate with. Hats of for a great customer experience!  Happy New Year!"

299,2,"What went wrong was EVERYTHING!!!  Buyer beware of SHIPT deliveries at Target.  We ordered a Vicks Vaporizer and Vicks vapor rub because my baby was sick.  We ordered at 7:30PM and were told it would arrive at 9:00PM from SHIPT.  Target asked special instructions for delivery and I just checked the box ""ring door bell"".  ""Jerry"" texted me back saying we don't have the item you ordered with pictures and they were pictures of doorbells!!!! What kind of people does Target have working for them.  Furthermore, he then text back to say I have the vaporizer and I am sorry for the mix up.  We ask when will you be here?  The Target store is 8 minutes from our house.  Now, it is 10:30 and we ordered at 7:30PM NO VAPORIZER OR VAPE RUB.  Spoke to the Target Lead CSR, she referred me to The target.com number spoke with Elisa....BIG MESS this store sucks when it comes to online.  Don't do it!!! Thank god I paid with credit card."
1146,0,I loved Target for years. I never saw this day coming but I will no longer buy clothes. Im sad they remodeled stores and they have cheapen the clothes and charge more for them. It looks like Goodwill in there. Bring back the old Target clothes..pleeeeaseThis vendor is not working
2204,0,"Ordered a hoverboard for a Christmas present.  Internal issue with the battery but because it's past their measly 90 day return policy they won't exchange it at all!  Now we are stuck with an expensive, defective item!!!  Not an adequate return policy for an item of this magnitude!  Also, service was not overly helpful and really didn't offer any sort of assistance.  They have their ""canned"" responses and that's it.  Very disappointing.  I'll be thinking twice before ordering ""cyber monday"" deals this Christmas!!!!"
458,0,"Disclaimer: This review strictly refers to Targets website and not any physical locations.As a who;e, I love Target stores. But this website is a complete mess. Each time I login it never remembers my credentials and I constantly have to reset my passwords. This is possibly one of the most annoying glitches I've ever experienced. I think I'll just stick with visiting the physical locations until the bonehead developers can get this mess sorted."
1264,0,"Because of COVID, they updated their return policy to not return Health and Beauty items. My dad bought me the wrong kind of headbands I needed so I took them back right after. They were unopened and only in my house less than an hour, not that it matters. The woman at the counter was rude; she looked at the item I put down on the counter, paused, and picked up the phone to call someone over the intercom about something unrelated to me. Then she says I can't return this because it's health and beauty, even though it's an unopened package of hairbands. It's not a lice outbreak, for Christ's sake. Their new policy sucks and I'm not going to buy anything from there again."
1458,0,"After my first order of canned foods came in with almost all dented cans, they gave me the opportunity to reorder the cans that came in dented. Guess what?

Buyer beware  ... it appears to me that they're trying to off load their dented canned foods !!"

827,0,"Needed 10 x 13 colored envelopes without ordering 50-100.  Target was the only place  where I found such.  Just a couple of quirks:  1.  I don't think I have ever seen  TAX specifically charged on SHIPPING.  It was only about 46 cents but tax on shipping?  You have to notice it when it displays because at the end it lumps the 2 taxes together and only one tax shows which most people would assume is the state sales tax on the product.  I wonder to what governmental organization that tax gets paid?  2.  If I set my billing address to default, I cannot change the mailing address.  Should always be able to change both addresses.  My CCard company has a specific address on file which does not include the company name.  Including company name make delivery easier.  3.  I did a screen print & they probably sent me an e-mail receipt but I looked and did not find any place on the site to print a paper receipt.  I like to document what is actually on the screen, not their revised version.Overall the ordering was OK but I still wonder about tax on shipping."
1692,0,"I love Target! So imagine how excited I was to see the inclusion of a product line, made with Black women in mind! I love the HoneyPotCo products & have even referred my family & friends to look into using them! Bravo to Target for their inclusivity and SHAME on all of you hating on this!!"
285,0,"This review is to acknowledge an individual at the W. Hillsborough Super Target store.Randy, Electronics Department, worked with me to transfer my cell phone carrier from Verizon to Visible. I had the information from Verizon to do this but Visible (Verizon) would not accept the information provided for this change.  Randy called Verizon Support in order to remedy the error we were getting.He followed through until the process was completed, Many more stars than 5 should be given to Randy."

2110,0,"My first and only order on Target.com...  I had 2 items I wanted to purchase from Target, and since we live on a little island with an expensive ferry, I figured it would be cheaper and faster to order online. Both items that I wanted said ""free 2 day delivery with $35 or more purchase.""  So I found another item to add to my order, bringing it to more than $35. After they took all of my information and finalized the sale, I got a notice that my order would arrive in 5 days. Really?  All along the process it was 2 days, and then when they have my money it is 5 days. Even if they don't count weekends, I should have my order by Wednesday, not Thursday. I called customer service, and the fellow was very polite, but the explanation he gave made no sense whatsoever. If I order on Amazon and it says 2 days, it takes1 or 2 days to arrive. I'll know better than to order from Target again if I need something right away."
865,2,"Ordered an item, light proof plastic roll, and received a monkey swing from Target. I ordered from Target because they offered the quickest delivery date.

Very bad business practice and I will never order anything from Target again."

640,0,"Used several Target gift cards towards purchase of a phone. The remaining $5.92 was charged to my RedCard.Two months later I get a letter in the mail demanding payment for $7.92. Upon checking my bank, which I use to pay all bills, I see that the scheduled payment was $5.92 was never sent.Target failed to send a email that the account was overdue yet searching my email account I found dozens of unread emails concerning their latest sales. Target failed to send a monthly invoice. Target failed to contact me at home via phone.Instead they added a $1.00 finance charge each month it was overdue and reported me to the credit bureau. As a result my near 850 excellent rating has dropped 99 points to just good. I have never had a late payment in the multiple decades I've owned credit cards.Say goodbye to any further business over the coming decades Target."

892,0,In today’s world it is an absolute shame that Target has chosen to take out the small section they had of plus size clothing. The heavy customers are now forced to purchase Target clothing on line only. Target is a huge corporation & should be ashamed to have singled out the heavy population. I will most definitely take my business elsewhere.
384,0,"Fake Shipping and Poor Customer ServiceI ordered fresh for $50 on target same-day delivery for dinner in the evening. After Target took my money, they didn't send me the item and sent me a fake photo as proof of delivery. Then I contacted customer service, and the customer service refused to help me with any problems and told me that sometimes, you just have to accept some unexpected situations. Then they reluctantly agreed to a refund at my very angry request but were unwilling to make any compensation."
1995,0,I had just started my shopping relationship with Target. I like the cleanest of their stores and the layout. Plus they seemed to have the right marketing and product. However tonight after the awful customer service we experienced I may never shop there again. The In store experience was completely awful. No one up front was properly trained for printing gift receipts and no one was available to help them perform this function. Then after checkout that took 40 mins the lady that came up- Betty had a horrible attitude which made me want to return everything. Betty was rude and uncaring For wasting other people’s times. We returned what we were able too without having to go some where else tonight like our ice cream that was now melted. I am half tempted to return our online orders from the week as well since the experience was completely ridiculous and not necessary.

440,0,"I usually write reviews when I'm pissed off by poor business practices of some entity, and I never thought I would take the time to write a good review about a big box store like Target of all places, but here I am. I am just really so impressed by their customer service. I have had to call a few times over the past couple years, and each time they have gone beyond expectations to make things right, even if what went wrong was kind of the customer's mistake.  I do get annoyed with the way Target overcharges bag tax when placing an online order and then does not always adjust it immediately or at all to reflect actual bag use, and I hope they do something system wide to truly address that constant issue. I also don't know what kind of labor practices Target patronizes in terms of manufacturing of Target affiliated brand items. This review pertains to Target.com customer service, which in my experience wholeheartedly earns the five stars. Thank you, Target."

2266,0,"There’s no guarantees that the store will get your order correct, and if it’s wrong, it’s your fault and the Target employees are rude... I ordered boxer briefs for my husband after he had visited our local Target several times over several months and they didn’t have the kind he always gets. We ordered online to be sure he was getting the exact kind he likes. When we went to the store to pickup, not only were they the wrong color, but the wrong style. When I mentioned this to the customer service rep, she admitted that whoever pulled the item from the shelves got the product number wrong, and that if my husband was that particular, we should just try a different store. The whole point of going online is to get what we wanted, even if it had to be shipped in. I don’t appreciate it being made our fault by being “particular” for the wrong item being pulled and then lack of help from the Target personnel."

1098,0,The Target app has a security flaw. We had placed an order using the app and someone had used our card in another state to purchase pick up items. Called Target customer service. They canceled the card and sent us a new card. We changed our pin and password. Placed an order today and the same thing happened again. Called customer service and they treated us like common criminals. So that is the end of Target for us. We have been customers for over ten years but going forward we will never shop in store or on line again.

Mine you I work from home so I’m there all day, no one knocked.  Look out front door nothing.  Contact Target and they say we show it delivered, but we will send another to arrive on the 20th.  I explained I will be out of town on the 20th and asked if they could hold it in a local store.  Told no they don’t hold items. So I asked if I could get a refund, she said she already put in for replacement so I would have to wait until I got an email saying it’s been ship, then call back and have it rerouted to the warehouse for full refund.  Very upset that I had to do all this, but called when I got the email, placed on hold for 45 minutes until I hung up and called back.  Then they tell me oh it’s not in transit yet and to call back again when it’s in transit.  I will never order or shop at Target again, this has been the worse experience ever"

259,0,"Never in my life have I been lifetime banned from a store website for shopping too smart.Target had a sale, buy 3 movies, video games or books get the 3rd (cheapest) for free.  So I bought 3 movies, all 3 not sold in stores.  Fringe Blu-ray complete Series, The Shield (or Sopranos I can't remember) Blu-ray complete series and Veronica Mars complete series (DVD or Blu-ray, don't remember).Veronica Mars was the cheapest and a great gift for my wife.  So I submit the order and like 4 hours later it got cancelled.  I figured some weird error happened so I did the order again.  Same thing, cancelled.I contacted support and they told me they would investigate and get back to me... I wait 3 business days and follow up.  I was told they don't know but not to try again then give me a phone number.I call and I'm told I'm banned FOREVER and to buy the items In store... The site says ""not sold in stores""!I mention this, I'm told owell too bad.  No reason given just banned.  Even my wife is banned and we have a long shopping history with target which they track based on address.I checked by trying to buy 3 books, order cancelled.  I even waited a few months and order a kitchen knife set... cancelled.  Target is a waste of money and time.  We have stopped shopping there completely, all because once I shopped too well and would have gotten a $40 DVD set free after spending like $160 on the other 2."
2357,0,"For the last several weeks every time I use my Redcard to shop at Target, I am told it is my fault that my REdcard does not work properly.  It fails again and again and takes forever to check out.  This morning after 20 minutes trying to check out I was again told that it is my fault and that there is nothing the personnel in the store can do to assist.  I was told to end this hassle I should call the number on the back of the card.When I did call, the person who answered told me that they could do nothing because the problem lies with the store.  So I am caught in the middle.finally the person cancelled my Redcard and issued a new one that is due to arrive in 7-10 business days.  In the meantime, I do not have a RedCard to use to take advantage of the 5% discount given to Redcard customers.  When I inquired about that I was told to delay all shopping at Target until the card arrives.  I am in the habit of shopping at Target 5-6 days a week due to its proximity to my home.I feel Target needs to get its act together.  both the people in the store and the one on the phone make it clear that they do not care what I think."
702,0,I am so disappointed in my experience ordering with Target online. They promised me a delivery date that worked for me being in town and then it is arriving 5 days early to sit outside until I can arrive. I called them and they only gave me the option of it sitting out front for almost a week or for me to have to go and pick this oversize heavy item up at the UPS store. They offered no compensation for the mistake and outright lie that was told to me about when I would receive it and then pushed me off the phone. I will NEVER order from them again.

After getting my adapter, I went to the arts and crafts aisles, the shelves were kinda empty and I couldn’t find the pencils I needed. I think Target should stock up more on products so the aisles. Overall, I had a good experience at this target."
1860,0,Target has alot of different things but it way to overly priced.
287,0,Lately target is putting shipping dates on products and then when purchased the delivery date is automatically delayed 3 days on average.  If target does not start using real ship dates I will be done ordering from target.  It is not worth their prices for the aggrevation
2330,0,"I usually never post reviews on the internet, but this store is awful. I ordered from the Target website and my item was supposed to be delivered in two days, but since it was the weekend, it would be delivered in 4 days. I was fine with that. But then the day comes when I'm suppose to receive my order and it never came. The tracking status changed and says expected delivery time is for the next day instead. So I wait again and nothing. Tracking says it hasn't even started moving yet. I called the shipping company they used and they said that shipping label was created but they have not received the package yet. I then called Target and they were not helpful saying if it doesn't arrive in two days to give them a call again and maybe they can just reorder it or give me a refund. I'm still waiting on nothing and shipping updates are not happening. Thanks for wasting my time and patience, Target. Will never shop there again."

Use a tiny amount with water in your hand and gently massage into scrap.  I like natural products so rosemary does not bother me but I guess some people like fake chemical based products that smell like flowers!!!!

948,0,Kudos to target for extra measures they’ve taken to keep customers safe during the pandemic. It is very much appreciated. Special thanks to Genesis at the Mansfield TX store for going above and beyond to help me find 2 items just before the snow storm and for walking me through the savings options in the app. What a kind person and great employee she is. Give that girl a raise!
1547,0,I was just at my local target in the Glendale galleria. My shopping experience was your average shopping experience. They need to have more carrying baskets at the entrances. But in light of hearing about this honey pot commerical I can no longer support Target. So 3 now turned to a 1.
2032,0,Although Target can be a little pricey they do have some good sales...There clothes and shoes are high quality... The workers there are very polite and helpful... The stores are very organist and maintained... The bathrooms are always very clean... I love their $ section... Unlike “some” multi billion stores who have horrible piece of crap shopping trolleys that is almost impossible to find a good one...Targets shopping trolleys are wonderful and I have never had a bad one... Love this store...
1148,0,"I recently discovered & found out that Target.com had managed to sneak & overcharge me an additional $1.32 for no apparent reason & without notice with an Online Purchase that I had placed with them.  Thank goodness, I paid for my Purchase through PayPal who cared for me & covered this anonymous & sneaky hidden overcharge that Target.com had managed to bill & charge me for on my Purchase with them.  This was totally without my permission & without any known reason for them for doing it.  I had to open a PayPal Dispute Case regarding this hidden & unknown Overcharge with Target.com.  They who never responsibly responded to me or PayPal with the open Dispute regarding this.From what I have researched & found on the Web, they have been known to have done this to their Customers in the past Years for no reason & without explanations of these extra unknown Overcharges.  My guess would be, that Target is doing this to some or most of their Customers for extra Money in their Pocket hoping that most People won't pay attention or even notice these unknown & hidden Overcharged Amounts on their Orders.  I am not happy with Target for doing this & thinking that Customers like me simply would not notice the extra hidden & unknown Overcharges on our Purchases which then allows Target to have extra spare Money in their Pocket from us.I do recommend that Target Customers watch & monitor their original Transaction Amounts with Target very closely as for they may likely be trying this rip off technique with all or most of their Customers to this day & with little to no one noticing or seeing these extra unknown & hidden Overcharges being secretly charged to their Credit Cards for current Orders placed with Target on Target.com."
635,0,"The customer service chat support needs some work. I reached out because I was continuing to get emails notifying me that part of my order was experiencing a shipment delay. I explained that I had already picked up the order a month ago and to please figure out how to stop the emails. He replied that the order was complete and did I need anything else. I messaged him that I realized the order was complete which is why I wanted the shipment delay emails to stop. He said I would need to speak to a ""senior escalation team member."" So, I waited, and when he came back to the chat, he said that no one on the senior escalation team was available and that I needed to check back in an hour. So, the short story is that I won't be reaching out in an hour because I have to go to work in an hour. And frankly, I'd like to have the 25 minutes I just wasted in the support chat, in addition to the time I've spent logging into Trustpilot and penning this review. On a side note, the chat was filled with misspellings, missing words, and the misuse of grammar. This doesn't give me much confidence in the agent's competency. Of course, I'll continue to use Target, but I'll probably just take my customer support issues into the store."
479,0,I made 1 order through them for the first time and they scammed us! Dont order online at all! Customer service is horrible! Gave no option for anything just we will give you a refund when we can.
1031,0,"I went to a Target in Diamond Bar,Ca.,More upscale with middle to rich people and saw the difference of stock they have versus other Targets I mainly shop. So I believe their catered mostly the the middle class to rich population where this store is located. But the service sucked regarding who comes to that store. When I had to pay the dum cashier had an attitude and smart ass to argue with me. She did not know how to do a red card scan and a gift card at the same time, I said really?. So her lead came and she even forgot to give me a $5.00 gift card for purchasing and item which was supposed to be included. Instead I had to walk to customer service waist some more time and no apology I said Wow! White privilege no kidding I would be fire if it was me or written up. So I hope the store Manager from that store reads reviews one in awhile and see how poorly some of their employees function. Take notes Manager and retrain your staff better from starting to be humble and helpful knowing that the customer pay their check specially right now in difficult times and also sponsored your store even with poor service."

I was than told the release of my money will be off by Monday 12/30. I called target.com on just to find out they charged my card for the protection plan! So Target is going to bill me for an item that I don’t even have!!! Are you for real?!!!! I had to call 3 times to finally get a refund processed for that protection plans! When I ask about the refund for my tv, I was told I have to wait 14 business day. WHAT DO YOU MEAN!!!!!! Target is stealing people’s money for products they don’t have to offer! This is the worst and they most unprofessional place I have ever made a purchase from and I will NEVER purchase from AGAIN!!! NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY IT IS A RIP OFF!!!!!"

How can a company this size be so messed up.  I love target but this experience makes me want to never shop there again.
1803,0,"*Shipping*- Please don't be fooled by their "" you spend $35 you get 2-day free shipping, That's false, ((Target uses sleight of hand)) Target does not  Display this information during the checkout/ nor in the fine print of the purchase page.up close magic is what i call it but to most consumers, it's ( false advertisement) Target does not ship in 2 days it takes them 2 days to have the product moved out of their store/warehouse, anytime after 12 pm you are on cut-off time meaning you will receive your item 2 days later in the week for example order placed on Thursday it may arrive on a Wednesday the following week. when asked about the shipping the customer service reps will send you a link that explains the shipping process. this is why they have a whole page to explain the shipping they don't want to pay the extra.25 or whatever small amount to ship items to there customers, I'm sure they have an account with , UPS-FedEx USPS because that's how they receive their in-store merch. as a shopper, It doesn't cost us much to ship using local services, its just pennies to a Fortune 500 company. Dear Target, this is why many of the stores are shutting down and customers are going to amazon. please value your customers a  bit more I'm sure this may be trial and error but you've had years to try and perfect it. Please do Better"

2564,0,becareful when you order at target  .com. They cancel your order after that they will charge delivery fees . I order more than 35 dollars but they sent me email I cancel my orders but I didn’t cancel. I called target customer service but that is their technical problem not my problem. After that they will replace the order for about that at that time they will take delivery charge after they did delivery they will take away delivery charge but no. I called back they refuse to refund delivery charge. what the big liars?So scary. Be careful
1172,0,This is pertaining to Target’s online shopping and pick up at store.  So about half the items I need say “not sold at this store” and I know they do sell it because before COVID I did go into the store shopping or “pickup not offered for this item” WHY?! Why would we use this way to shop when you can’t get half your list.  I think it is terrible and if Target wants to compete with all the other stores that offer this way of shopping they better get with the program.

The commercial is stupid and lost it with that sentence as soon as I heard it. Like you couldn't have just said the next girl?"
2515,0,"I wish I could select -0 .  I was at Target in North Richland Hills, TX tonight buying a couple things I needed before my trip. While paying for the items I asked Andres the casher if he could please change two hundred dollar bills for me and he replied ""This is not a bank"" I said "" I thought it was"" then he said there is an ATM machine by the exit sign. I asked him what do I need an ATM machine for?  I only wanted to break my two bills and he gave that stupid and smart answer. I spent $100 dollars tonight but in the past I bought a couple iPads and a laptop so is not like I'm spending pennies. I was very dissatisfied and very upset after all. I will take my business somewhere else where they will appreciated better. Target should fire this idiot before they lose more customers because his poor customer service skills"
2287,0,I received my order in a box that was four times larger than the actual item inside. Why would you waste our natural resources by shipping in a box that is clearly way too big for the item shipped? What a disappointment and a waste.

They said I would have to reapply to get a card again.  That's not happening!  Good bye target!"
668,0,I went to use my card today and it declined. They said they lowered my limit due to inactivity. It’s been less than 11 months since I last used the card.

545,0,"Clean stores are the big attraction for me. They don't always have everything I need, but this is balanced out by an excellent, non-judgy return policy. I like that i get 30 days to try something and then return it with no questions asked (did this recently with new pillows)."
1899,0,"Target has many promotions like $X gift card free with $Y purchase. So $10 gift card if you buy $50 goods. Check your receipt, guys. I have been Over-charged many many times. If you buy goods worth $52, it will charge $10 for gift card. Also will reduce item of goods by $10. The purpose is the total should remain 52. What the receipt shows is Goods charge 42, gift card 10 and total 62. Yessirreee $62!!! Means it charged you for the gift card as well. Very very sneaky and slimy. You walk up to Guest help and they will convince you that the $10 gift card charge is fine coz the price of the goods has been reduced. Very very very slimy.If Target does not want to get sued, it should return money of all people it over-charged and made a complete fool off. Poor folks  thinking they were getting free promotional gift cards, when like gullible buffoons they over spent, buying goods in excess and then even paid for promotional gift cards."
2423,0,I ordered a air fryer on cyber Monday. I thought the shipping was taking a while so I decided to check the order information. Upon doing so I saw that the order was cancelled. Decided that I’d  call target customer service line spoke to carol she said that she has to charge me full price then refund me the difference. In most cases I would have been okay with it but seeing is how target is the one who canceled my order I asked to speak to the supervisor. His name was Jc and he just reiterated everything carol said. I decided to just cancel the order.

I was login into my online account and I tried to chat with customer service unsuccessfully because there is a page for that matter but when I enter my name, email, and I press chat, the page does not respond. I called @ 800-440-0680 and they tread me like garbage, I understand they to verify your information but the attitude of the representative who handled my call was unacceptable despite the fact that she fail to do it from the beginning because I asked first, why their system does not allow me to enter an Amex number and at that moment she already knows the answered but makes waste my time verifying all my information to tell she can't add a credit card for me which that was not what I was asking her to begin with. My question was, why I can not add an Amex as a payment method and I can add a Visa and she only keeps apologizing without giving an alternative resolution.

1811,0,"I've contacted Target Guest Services, as well as the Board of Directors and the CEO with the following:Ms. Dixon's statement was so much more than ""inappropriate"" it was racist... plain and simple.  I believe that Target can and should creatively market or advertise your unique brand and trendy products without the mention in race.  In mentioning race, Target and its partners are perpetuating and contributing to the seemingly endless cycle of hate that we as Americans find ourselves dealing with every single day.  A couple of years ago, H&M was in a very similar situation because a little black boy was seen in an ad with a t-shirt that had a monkey on it.  The shirt said ""coolest monkey in the jungle.""  All hell literally broke loose.  It was in the media and all over social media... everywhere you looked, it was there.  The Weekend tweeted ""woke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo.  I'm deeply offended and will not be working with @hm anymore...""  The H&M ad was pulled and the shirt was removed from all stores nationwide.  There is a NY Times article that details several other companies: Dove, Nivea and Pepsi, all of which had to deal with the fallout from their similar situations. You might be asking yourself why I'm bringing this up.  And, in turn, I would ask you, How is Ms. Dixon's Target commercial any different from the H&M situation?  In short... It's not.   While I completely support small businesses and their ability to grow and expand with the assistance of larger companies like Target, I don't understand how something of this magnitude was missed.  As I stated in my original email, if a Caucasian entrepreneur had even hinted at anything remotely close to something that might have been construed as something racial, the buck would have stopped there... the conversation would have been stopped mid-sentence and the Caucasian entrepreneur would have been promptly dismissed.  Yet somehow, a black entrepreneur says ""so the next black girl can have a better opportunity"" and all is supposed to good and wonderful in the world.  Is Target saying that this commercial is appropriate because only Caucasians are racists?  If so, Target has much larger problems than even I thought it had.As a Caucasian consumer, I'm offended by Ms. Dixon and Target.  I'm offended that you've defended Ms. Dixon and her poor choice of words.  I'm offended that as a Caucasian I'm viewed as racist.  And lastly, I'm offended that my genuine concern for the greater good is being dismissed so easily.  I didn't bring race into this issue... Ms. Dixon did and Target is supporting it.  SHAME ON YOU TARGET!"

1999,0,"So I was in the Jersey City store between 18th and 14th street.  I was purchasing toys for a charity work event and was in a super rush.  I had to quickly try something on and when doing so I left my jacket in the dressing room- may i also say that my keys were in the pocket.  I was FRANTIC!  They led me to the service desk, the girls looked everywhere to see if It was put back...no luck.  I came back very upset because this event was very important to me when a lovely girl named KAYLA had found my jacket.  I apologize that I do not know her managers name but she was so fabulous as well.  I did not have cash on me but they would not except any type of award from me and said ""this is just what we do here at Target""  All I have to say if we had more people like this in the world we would live in a much brighter and beautiful place.

I let them know that I did not want the other table if I could not get both but they told me they could not cancel the order as it has already shipped. I called UPS (horrible customer service as well) and they told me they could not cancel the shipment because they did not have it yet. Between the 2 companies I received no help and will end up with 1 table that I do not want. Awful experience. Don't order from Target online. You will be disappointed as well.

I used a gift card due too so much identity theft and once it was used it was tossed !!!! Now they tell me after I call and say it was refunded to card but IT WAS NOT !!!!! No purchase and out $65So I ASSURE you I won’t spend another $ in the store ever !!!!
1959,2,"So sorry I opened a Target credit card account. They are the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Their system did not accept a payment I made online on the same account I've made telephone payments on. They charged me a late fee and have punished me ever since by withholding my payments a week or more after the bank shows the payment cleared. I have dealt with numerous customer service men via the phone- no one explains or corrects the problem. As of today I am cutting up the Red Card, paying off my balance as soon as possible and I will NEVER set foot inside a Target Store again. There are zillions of stores to shop in, Target will not be one I frequent."

1746,2,"Unfortunately, I find the Honey Pot commercial very racist. Why was it necessary to use the words ""black girl"" instead of ""any girl""? Racism goes in all directions..I'm certain Target examined the product for possibilities, not the color of the girl's skin.The commercial should be revised or removed.  As it is, it does not create a favorable impression of Target."

After speaking to his parents I learned that he had received a snowspeeder when he should have received an x-wing. He loved the snowspeeder but I had paid for an x-wing (more expensive than snowspeeder). So I called Target and explained the problem. The rep verified my order and then said he was sending an x-wing to my grandson (no charge to me), that he could keep the snowspeeder and he insisted on sending me a $5 gift card. I was very happy with the level of customer serviceI. It left me with a very positive experience which will bring me back to Target. That's how a store competes with Amazon!"

When I finish checking out it says item will arrive 10 days later not 2. I ordered items for a trip I'm going on and they wont be in on time. I called for a refund and they said they can only offer a gift card as a return. What a dishonest system to cheat us. I could have ordered sooner but as I was comparing prices I took the time to check out other venders thinking I would have time to fall back on a target order. Now I know.

I went back to the store to try and fix this issue. I spent another 4 hours in the store that day without getting any help from a manager or an apology but they gave me a 20% off coupon. After four hours there that day they told me I would have to come back on Sunday and on Sunday I came back and spent two hours sitting until someone could finally help me only to find out i would have to wait again until Monday and come back. Another few hours wasted and again no manager apologized or anything. Monday morning they told me to come in when they opened and I arrived at 8 to wait another three hours until I finally received the xs that I originally wanted and after complaining to the manager they gave me a measly 20 dollar gift card for the phone after wasting most of my holiday weekend sitting in there store. I will no longer be a target customer after this experience seeing as they do not look out for their customers even after an employee makes a mistake."

It was so bad, I felt the need to speak with the manger, the response was very underwhelming. Shelves where poorly stocked, carts blocking the exits on the front door and generally the place was filthy. Given that I do not often visit a Target, is this the norm for them? Frankly I expect little from Ocean State Job Lot, (A low budget  discount New England chain store)  however compared to Target, Ocean State looks like a Crown Jewel.."

2460,0,"Don't fall for target's Black Friday buy one get one 50% off on toys. It only gives almost 25% off, which would be fine if that's what was advertised. My receipt even says the deal on it, but some how 50% off of 14.99 is 3.41, 50% off 17.99 is 4.09, 50% off 21.99 is 5.22. Anyone who's passed 3rd grade math can tell that's not 50% off. What are they trying to pull?"
2002,0,"Tried to return a coffee pot WITH the receipt & the customer service rep acted bothered that I had even questioned if I could get an exchange. I knew going in that the receipt was dated quite a few months but thought maybe they would honor it (which would have been the customer service thing to do), or at least to have gone over the appliance return policy with me.. Politely thanked the woman for her help & asked if she would throw the coffee pot away for me being that I had no use for a nonworking coffee pot & she huffed and gruntled at me. However a very nice woman working in the houseware department stopped to ask if we were finding everything ok which made the trip feel slightly better. Target on Seaboard St in Myrtle Beach."
2324,0,Bad quality to giving 2 star because of customer service
2284,0,I purchased curtains at a Target store on Queens Boulevard in New York on 3/26/19.  I tried to return the curtains the same day at Target located at College Point in Queens on 3/26/19.  A customer service representative told me I had to wait 24 hours because it was not showing I’m the system yet.  I was not happy with that.  Target needs to fix that if that was true.  Does anyone know if that’s correct?
525,0,"So this isn’t new I just hoped a different store was better. Millerville store in Baton Rouge is aweful. Open until 10, changing rooms closed apparently at 7. 24 check out lanes and 2 open. And good luck finding a manager. Worse than Walmart."
1606,0,After over 30 years of shopping at Target you have lost me. I want women to support women. By openly saying to empower the next black girl is shutting down the next white girl. All young girls should feel empowered. What would the comments be if the ad changed black to white?
1888,0,"This review is mostly about the target app since I use that more than the website. The app recently went through some big changes. I think the target ""circle"" design is gone now and what you see with the app now is much easier to use. I like the interface now because you can shop by category a lot easier than in the past but it's still a work in progress. For instance, I was recently shopping for bathroom accents and it was hard to locate. I had to go back and forth to different categories to eventually find it under the home section. All in all its better than before."
1455,0,"On August April 24th, I placed an order with Target for a Thermaltake computer case to be delivered on April 28th.  On the 26th, I received an email pushing my delivery date to May 4th.  On April 28th, I received an email indicating my delivery would not be delivered until May 5th but that the order had been “shipped”.  On the morning of May 5th, I checked the UPS shipping number to determine when my package would be delivered, but the UPS status indicated they hadn’t even received my package.I called Target and waited on hold for almost 30 minutes before speaking with someone who indicated they would have to transfer me to another department that could help me.  I held after the transfer for another 30 minutes before being disconnected.  I called the 2nd number back and after holding for 10 minutes, I left my contact information for a call back.  After 4 hours, I still had not received a call back.  I called the 2nd number again and waited for close to an hour before speaking with a customer service representative.  She told me she could refund my money or we could try to determine what had happened to my package.  Target had sent me multiple emails indicating the delivery date of my package, and they did not, in fact, have any idea where it was.  The only way they had to contact Thermaltake vendor was an email address (I googled and found a number for them the following day.)  They sent the company an email and CCed me so I could be made aware of the progress.  The following day (May 6th, 12 days after the order had been placed), I called the 2nd number again and was on hold for over an hour.  I spoke with a representative who confirmed they’d received an email from Thermaltake the previous evening (I was not included) and the information I’d been provided the previous day was incorrect. Even though Thermaltake could only say they’d look into it, Target’s policy was to not provide any kind of refund until 48 hours after the anticipated delivery date (a date they apparently just made up).  I would have to wait until Friday, call and be on hold for another hour (at least) just so I could get my refund.  I originally encouraged not ordering anything from Target or buying anything from Thermaltake, but as a result of this experience, I strongly recommend not doing business with either of these companies.  Target has already taken my money and refuses to refund it even after they’ve confirmed the product I ordered hasn’t even been shipped from the manufacturer.  Thermaltake has a telephone number, but no one answers it and no one returns calls.  It’s unfortunate that there seems to be no concern for the well being of the customer.  All for less than $200."
1232,0,I put the xbox series x in my cart at 11:00am ET and got stuck.  I reattempted several times and the page would never let me move forward with my order.  I had a cart number and called Target where the woman proceeded to tell me that my cart number was invalid.  Then after 1 hour of attempting to move forward with my order the site tells me that the preorders were sold out.  I think this is Horrible!  I can understand if I waited to preorder but I did not.  It allowed me to put the item in my cart at 11:00am and then never allowed me to move forward with my order.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!
806,0,The Black Santa was great.  It came very quickly. Please
442,0,I purchased a RCA TV from Target. 38 days after purchasing the TV it stopped working.  When I called Target about exchanging the TV I was told that they only guarantee the TV for 30 days and that they couldn't do anything to help me. I was very disappointed $500 wasted! Target has lost a consumer in me. I will never purchase anything from them again
847,0,The target.com website forces you to register; you can't purchase as a guest. Guess I won't be shopping Target again.
462,0,"I will not be using Target.com again.  I ordered some items for my granddaughter's first visit with us.  I specifically ordered items that had a delivery date before her arrival.  Today, 7/15/22, on my scheduled delivery date, I received an email letting me know that the items will be arriving late and hasn't even been shipped yet. One of the items is shipping from a warehouse 4 hours from my house!  This is not acceptable and I will not be using them again."
155,0,Just lost my business and my communities business. Thank your gender department!
2469,0,Target online prices are not the same prices in store Target says that they are not affiliated with their own website and do not price match what is on their website and will not sell you the price that is online don't bother it's a bait-and-switch company
984,0,"I purchased 5 different items online. Initially prompted me that items I'm purchasing are available for same day delivery. Boy was I wrong to order from Target. At check out it turned out that its only available for 2-days. That 2 days became  7 days, then 10 days. I get delayed shipment emails every day. Now my order are being delivered one item per day, such a waste.  One of the items is 3 orders of a hand soup, which came in 3 different shipment almost 2 weeks after Target's delivery claim of same day delivery. Target online ordering is at least a decade behind today's norm."
743,0,"We're sourcing propane canisters for a gas camp stove in anticipation of a power outage. Today Target sold us some that they didn't actually have, wasting 90 minutes of a very busy evening of preparation.I can deal with out of stock, delays and other inevitable artifacts of doing business, but being lied to crosses the line. Last time in a target store."
114,0,This company has poor morale ethics and has an agenda to push inappropriate beliefs on our children. I hope Americans wake up and let them flop.

872,0,"Dylan Santiago was very rude to me , kept pushing me alway and didn’t help me find anything I was looking for !!!! He is the worst customer ever this is my 4th time coming there and dealing wit his rude ass"
745,0,Absolutely a waste of time and highly unprofessional online ordering service.A company that does not care about the customer just the bottom line.Canceling orders you have advertised as in stock is fraudulent and false advertising.As it is you stockpile these figures to delicately give them away on the shelves and scalpers get most so you suck target and suck badly.I hope you go out of buisness with this unprofessional attitude on selling your products.
633,0,"I have used Shipt 4 times over the last 6 weeks. On my 2nd delivery my shopper texted she noticed a couple small items missing that Target must have forgotten to bag. It was not a big deal to me, I did not think anything of it. Today, I had my 4th delivery. My shopper texted me a similar message, however this time Target had forgot to bag xyz…$42 worth of items. My shopper went on to say “I swear I saw the cashier at target put everything in one bag and they aren't in my car. I understand if you have to penalize my shop, I just wanted to personally apologize for the inconvenience.”I was appalled and very concerned, however I imagined Shipt would handle the issue and want to stop this from happening right away. While trying to get a hold of them for over an hour, I called Target who verified the items had been returned for cash/gift card with my gift receipt.The supervisor at Shipt said it was a billing issue and I had to EMAIL customer service, end of story/period! I told the supervisor this is a fraud issue, not a billing one, he did not care. I will pursue this matter but not through Shipt, I feel that would be a waste of my time. I’m extremely upset on so many levels."
2462,0,"So disappointed.  Two days ago I checked a price for a baby doll for my daughter for Christmas.  Today, BLACK FRIDAY, the price is jacked up! Aren't things supposed to be on sale on black friday??"
629,0,Be honest I never go to target store.  the only reason I went there was because only target have something I need . The cashier Ilian made the difference about my desition to cambak. He was ameizing friendly and super sweetheart for his age he is doing great in this company
1890,0,"I continue to be disappointed in Target.  They'll run a promo for a free gift card with purchase and I'll NEVER receive it at check-out.  I always wind up going to customer service to get it.  What a pain.  I just ordered some household supplies online and did not receive the $15 promo card once again.  The store layout is all in disarray now, you can't find anything, they're often out of items that are on sale, it's just a very frustrating store.  I never thought I'd say this, but Walmart is better!"
1881,0,"Target sucks!!! I have been trying to tell them for 3 days now that someone opened up an account in my name and has charged up over $300. I'm receiving notices to my email. They told me, well you ordered it, which i told them NO I DID NOT!!! I even had one of their customer team member named Stephanie hang up on me. Then they said they would make sure i would not receive notices but were going to leave my email on this account. IT IS MY EMAIL AND YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO KEEP IT ON AN ACCOUNT THAT IS NOT MINE!!! I use to like Target but they just lost me as a customer and i will make sure that i tell everyone about how difficult Target is on reporting fraud to them."
724,0,"I have to say they cannot get their order dates straight within their own circle.  One, it will be delivered by 9th, (on the same site I order my item which is now delayed) but puck out not til after 10th of month. Are you slightly confused, not to mention they extended your arrival date for item.  Reps are parrots, all taught to say same sentences,  All in all..just go somewhere else and save yourself a lot of aggravation! I don’t think they know exactly when their items will be delivered or even shipped!  Mine has NOT shipped yet..I am not confident."
2281,0,"First, I’d like to say thank you for selling Paramour bras in size 36DDD. However, only the solid colors are a true fit to size. The bras that have designs on them don’t come close to size. The design also takes away from inches. I love the bras and I truly thank you for making them affordable, but I hope you’ll fix this problem. Thank you"

2280,0,"My review is based solely on my experience with their online store (Target.com). I don't have any issues with my local store, as they are professional and personable.I recently made a purchase that was cancelled by Target, due to a shipping error, the reason of which was never fully disclosed nor did I receive an email to confirm this. At the time I received a message on CHAT on the app (I had connected with Target about the order on the app, at first) from Chris, I was speaking to a service rep on the phone  who tried to help me with the order because I wanted to know when it would ship or why it hadn't progressed. I was told by the phone customer service rep that my order was cancelled by me at the same time Chris said it was cancelled by Target. I said I didn't cancel the order! No clear reason was given.but it seems by many of the responses on this platform, they regularly cancel orders. I don't have a problem witht hat, because errors by customers or Target could happen, but the lie about it what made me angry and the cancellation made me angry. I asked chris when I would be refunded to me and he said ""45 hours."" Anyway, I recontacted target.com and describing my problem with customer services, they presented me a $10 egift card for me (which they didn't have to do) to apply to my next purchase after I made the complaint about the cancellation, which I thought would be the end of it. Well, where's my refund? Oh, no refund!Before I realized this, I reordered the same order they originally cancelled, thinking I would have the original money back into my account.  Had I know I wouldn't get my money back at the time frame which they discussed, I would not have made the second order.I did contact Target again, and they said it was an authorization on my account that has to be settled on Paypal's side. Mind you, I used my Paypal available balance -- not bank account attached to paypal -- to pay for that order.  There was a lot of going back and forth on this.I then spoke to a level 2 specialist and somebody from corporate; both told me they did what they could with cancelled order. I kept contacting Paypal who sent several messages to the merchant, to no avail. This went back and forth; and nothing. Lie after lie, fruitless ohone call after phone call, I finally filed a ticket with Paypal to force Target to cancel the order they said they cancelled. The second-tier specialist, I felyt, was a smarmy patonizing individual and was just as unhelpful as the other person I spoke to at the corporate level.  He couldn't do anything because they canceled the order. Funny. I didn't get an email notification ro anything - just something on the app that showed it was cancelled and the message I got.After going back and forth with Paypal, I had to get somebody there to file a ticket to force the cancel, because apparently, target never actually cancelled the order, in full. I hope that solves the problem.I support what Target does for the community and standing by inclusive ideals, and my local store is great, but target.con online is trash, full of patronization, and a lot repeaters and people who don't know what's going on, and some are not exactly honest. I don't blame them, individually, as I blame more on the coporate culture. Apparently, Target withholds people's money for as long as they can and refuse to help, in this situation.I think If my money is not returned to my account by Monday, April 8th, I will contact the authorities for fraud, report it to BBB, and seek legal intervention about this.I will never shop at another Target, again - anywhere."
1001,0,"Target in Swansea, Mass. so several different people when in today looking for the coveted Bullseye Playground gumball machines that are $3.00. More than one person was told by staff that “the manager wants them and won’t let us put them out”!. As a former Target employee for more than 5 years I can most certainly tell you this goes against their policy! It must be on the floor first before it can be purchased! Very disheartening and I know their “manager” is breaking the rules and seems to have ZERO issues letting anyone know about it!"
167,0,Never shopping at Target again.  Selling SATAN KIDS PRIDE etc.
729,2,"Abysmal customer service. Out of maybe 10 or so interactions with them, I'm always left unsatisfied and my issues are left unresolved. I truly dislike Target.com. I hear that the website is run by a different entity than the stores. I tend to enjoy my in-store experiences at least but I also tend to shop at amazon and walmart more often due to the experience online."

439,0,"Choosing Target was the single most important decision I ever made. I bought a TV from it last week and the quality is very good. The customer service was very patient and informed me in detail about the operating instructions of the TV, I am very satisfied with this purchase. I will continue to support it in the future too！"
2430,0,"Ordered items on Black Friday and was out of town for Thanksgiving. Came back to find out that they change their hold policy from 11/15 - 12/1 from 7 days to 2 days (only store that I have found to do this) and my items were cancelled. I contacted their chat CS and they stated I would not be charged since the items were cancelled. Low and behold, the next day I was charged for these items. Now instead of a refund, they are trying to give me a Target gift card. Since I am not shopping there anymore, don't want a gift card. Called CS and they said their website states that they cannot refund PayPal payments on cancellations. Went back to the website and it states that they do not refund returns, but nothing about cancellations, which are both separated in their policy. They stated that didn't matter, that I would have to wait 30 days for a PayPal refund.  So they went from, it is not possible to refund PayPal payments to it will take 30 days. Also, while dealing with CS, was hung up on twice, and wait times were about 20 minutes originally and each time I called back. Definitely my last transaction with Target."
1427,0,"DO NOT USE TARGET.COM! I placed an order, immediately realized an error, I called to get help correcting the error, after being on hold for 1.5 hours, The customer service agent disconnected the call and he did not even bother calling back. I had to call back and wait another one hour and 17 minutes just to be told that it was too late to make changes because the items were processing. I never received my items nor received any further help. Target customer service sucks and $136 wasted. Now I am going to have to go through the bank and file a transaction dispute since i never received the items"

344,0,"Actually NONE stars. Their customer service is a joke, completely non-existent to the point that their constant month long inaction, incompetence and wasting of my time after more than a dozen attempts to resolve their failure to deliver an order that even shows on the tracking went back to them, yet, they can't figure it out and resulted in my filing a fraud complaint, back charging the payment and never shopping there again.

Placed order for my nieces and nephews. It’s now 12/19 and I’ve recieved daily emails that my order delivery date has been moved back and HASN’T EVEN SHIPPED YET. Email support—useless. Just got canned response along the lines of ‘higher than normal order volume.’ Got fed up and found support #. Now 45 mins on hold and writing this as I wait. NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM TARGET.COM."
1609,0,The honeypot ad is very very racist.  Can you imagine what would have happened and been said if it was a white girl doing the ad???  You would do well to take it off your ads.  I thought I was the only one offended.  I’m pleased to see that I’m not.  They should be more concerned about t helping ANY young woman getting a start in her own company.
51,0,"I called Target for a price adjustment. Both the customer service rep and the manager were unable to do it correctly. When you purchase an order, use a gift card, and pay with your target red card the price adjustment should automatically be refunded to your target red card. Instead they refund the gift card balance and then the red card. If I am purchasing something from Target, why would I want the gift card back? Logical sense is to apply the refund portion to the charge card before giving a customer a gift card. Their answer was...it applies it back based on the way the invoice was charged and there's nothing I can do to help you, but...if you go to the store they can return and then apply the gift card and then charge your card. So, I wasted my time calling target customer service. Their staff is incompetent and cannot manually refund a red card and do simple math. After wasting my time on a call with customer service, I need to now drive down there and do all this work to get a proper price adjustment. No thanks....I'll shop somewhere else in the future. I hate bad customer service."
1927,0,"Horrible customer service. HORRIBLE. Would do everything to push the responsibility away. I placed an online order with an unique coupon code from applying the target red card, didn't even get an order confirmation number and nothing shows up on order history. BUT the target red card shows a pending transaction. Online chat, emailed, and called target.com and red card department, just pushed me from one department to another saying they cannot find my order and can do nothing to help. The coupon was for one time use and no longer valid. I was informed I will not be issued a new coupon cuz they won't (GREAT customer service). Spent two dealing with the issue and never got resolved. Wasted too much time and effort for an order. I used to love Target but from now on I will never shop at Target again."

2507,0,"Target offers ""ZERO"" customer service especially when dealing with issues of any kind ""AND"" they just like all the other shithole companie outsource to other countries so they don't have to pay high taxes if any at all!! By outsourcing they are allowing the people from the other countries to mess with your credit card accounts and change things without your knowledge and then bully you when you confront them for messing with your account without letting you know they've made changes!!! No wonder Target had a data breach they outsource to other countries where this has been an issue where the data breaches continually happen. When you call to complain no one listens to you but hey this is what you can expect from a leftist liberal democrat company especially a company that ""DOES NOT"" provide a corporate phone number, makes one wonder what Target (NOT) Greatland is trying to hide!! I will not shop at Target anymore if they continue to outsource to other countries where those people are allowed to treat you like the dump in the toilet!!"

1138,0,"Not surprised, but the customer service rep I got barely understood English. I asked if Target keeps record of product details for things that are now unavailable online. There are many reasons I might want this information. The representative misunderstood me several times, kept stating the obvious (yes I know the product page is unavailable, that's why I'm asking), and refused to give a yes or no answer. In the end they asked me to ""please keep searching this item"". I could barely comprehend their meaning. I'm sure Target keeps some record of products somewhere, but customer service can't help me or direct me to a more appropriate contact."
1921,0,I placed an order and updated my address to my current. Target shipped my packages to my old address.  I called after noticing this was happening from the tracking info and they told me it was fixed.  Later that day my packages arrived at my old address.  I called got a replacement & guess what they yet again shipped it to my old address.  These were Christmas presents.  I spent over 6 hours over 3 days dealing with these people.  I asked for a manager numerous times and was always told no one was available.   Not once did anyone even apologize to me.  I was offered a refund that takes 7-10 days and then had to reorder to get these on time.  So now Target has charged me 2x and cant even get the address right.  I tried going in store they cant help in anyway when it comes to Target.com.  Also it is a rare occasion to get someone who speaks fluent English which in a bad situation like this.. SO irritating.  I am a frequent customer of Target and will NEVER NEVER NEVER order online again even if my life depended on it.  Buyer Beware.. THEY DO NOT CARE
1923,0,If I can give no star I would. I order this disney princess bike for my daughter and it will be her first bike as a christmas present. I was so excited and trust target that I will get the bike I ordered correctly. I didn't open our package until the day before christmas to assemble it and when my husband open the target box we got a different bike. We couldn't return it nor get something else because it is too late the stores are already closed and no other store is open.I can not believe they will make this kind of mistake. The picture is outside the box.
2149,0,"Encountered the most rude employee today! Had no intentions of helping me make things right! Her name was Toleeda or something like that. I had my receipt and the total return did not include the $20 store credit I used to pay for other items that I was NOT returning. I also paid $80 with my debit card. My total return was $80 and she said that $20 HAD to go back to a store credit and that was all that could happen because that's what the system does. And she was completely rude about it! I told her that was not right and she argued with me over and over and refused to get a manager. She just kept repeating herself that ""the system"" was right and I was wrong and there was nothing she could do for me! After arguing with her for longer than I cared to be there she did an override and gave me my $80 back which she could have done in the first FN place!!!!!!"
470,0,The executive Lori in guest relations is a conman. She voided my gift card and then told me I did this “knowingly or unknowingly” she is a conman.

I told her that the one I returned arrived a week before and I was looking for my corrected order. I get put on hold and then she comes back and tells me she refunded me and that it would be 7 days to see the refund. I didn't want a refund, I wanted the item. Bumbling fools from start to finish.

I really wanted the bedspread and now I am without anything after 2 weeks. They don't seem to have a handle on things. Wondering how they got so big. Hoping to get my refund. Not sure about that now."

Although I spend more than I want. Ha! Also, have done the curbside pickup and that was awesome! Thank you for having this as an option!"
2193,0,"Do not order from target.com if the order is for some reason is not what you asked- you will have a hard time getting your money back. Target does not take ownership, they act like you know it is another vendor. They have $199.90 from an order where the woman texted me and said she was pregnant and needed to get someone to put the item in her car. I then she came back and said it was not in stock. I still have not received my refund.The same day I ordered something that was a bait and switch. Showed a full product but came as partial product. Target will not take ownership for this $186.58 screw up"

1466,0,"I like Target. I recently ordered 2 orders from Target. The first one arrived in 2 boxes and was perfect.  The next order arrived in 1 large box. Inside was about 1/2 canned goods and 1/2 soft goods -- chips, crackers, etc. This box arrived smashed and partially open, Inside about 1/2 of the canned good were dented. Inside all of the soft goods were smashed and ruined. Two bags of Doritos, Lays chips, and crackers were all in about 100,000 pieces.  When I informed Target, they credited me back for a few items and offered to re-ship my order for free. It has now been almost 3 weeks, and the order is un-shipped with no information. Frankly, while I was okay with getting the order re-shipped, by this point I would prefer to just get a credit and shop elsewhere. Target ignores my calls and emails. They are giving LOUSY service... so I sold my Target stock as I presume they are getting a LOT of angry and unhappy customers. A real shame!!!UPDATE:Oh yeah, that order that I thought was perfect. I have since examined my PayPal and charge card more closely.  For about 2 minutes the order was scheduled to ship to an old address before I cancelled the order and re-keyed it to our correct address. I now notice that even though they had cancelled this first order immediately, they billed me partially for the cancelled order that never shipped... so BOTH orders were actually wrong. And good luck EVER reaching a human being at Target.com. BUYER BEWARE!!!"

There were two older ladies there and told me I could only bring in five items and I only brought 3 in. After trying on the swimsuits I left them on the hook because they didn't fit.Then one of the ladies told me to get them out of the stall.I brought two out because one didn't have a hook . One lady whispered ""I think she stole."" to the other lady and pointed to me.I felt offended 😭because I didn't even have a big enough purse to fit anything in.They also asked why i didn't get any of the items I tried on.Other than that target has great products."

However when I wanted to return some items, target didn’t accept the return because it was more than 3 months. I called customer service, after being on hold for a long time, finally they email me a barcode to return those items. Then when I went to store ( during the covid 19 pandemic) they told me this barcode doesn’t work!!!I also had a couple of online return with printed return barcode from target website, but they also didn’t accept those return!! Please just don’t buy anything online from target if you are not 100 percent sure, because there is no return option"

I love going shopping there.Walking into Target Grafton...you are met with a warm welcome & offer of any assistance.  I love checking out the fashions...from business to casual..and the homewares to spruce up my abode. The cosmetic range is super & I often find myself lost in the kitchen range!But beyond  the Target product is the great staff.  Maybe cause it is a large country town...or maybe Target choose great people but they are always friendly, warm, helpful, energetic & although they are often busy they give u a smile & service that makes your day!Special mention to the front end supervisors...you rock! Keep up the great work & thank you!"
239,0,"I just had another terrible experience at Target with Drive-Up for groceries. To keep this short, and to the point, I sat in my car for 20 minutes while I watched cars, again, drive up, get their groceries and leave. I finally flagged  down one of the employees outside and asked where is my order and this kid, Matthew, said oh, I’m sorry that was me. I thought another girl had your order, so he signed it off. He thought it was funny because he was smiling and thought it was amusing the whole time he was telling me. I went into the store because the ice cream was like mush, and the manager had the same ridiculous attitude as this kid. I am truly done with Target. There are too many other good stores out there where I don’t encounter these repeated problems."
981,0,All of my orders have been processed fast. Free shipping is great. You can tell they are really trying to be customer service oriented. I had a couple items that were broken during shipping.

474,0,"I liked Target until I had to contact customer service. I ordered a cabinet, it was delivered on time, but it was damaged upon arrival and it wasn't the delivery service. A bamboo piece that was packed tightly must have been damaged at the factory but someone packed it anyway.

So three weeks in, I still don't have a complete cabinet and am disappointed that Target customer service is so disorganized."

945,0,"I order a trampoline on target.com I was sent the item that was shipped from their partner store which is VM express. My granddaughter opened it the day after Christmas. The first thing I noticed was the hook to put the bungee cords on was bent up so badly. I then take all the poles out to attach them and noticed they are bent and scratched up, it doesn't sit evenly on the floor. I contact target and got nothing but the run around given multiple numbers to call, one rude person after another. Finally I get someone who say I need to pack it back up print of a return label and send it back. I informed them that upon delivery, the box was wet, dirty, full of holes etc. They said I need to go purchase a box pack it and ship. I then was told I had to pay for the shipping and that was the best they could do. I filed a complaint with the BBB. They responded with I know its not the answer she was looking for but its the best we can do and they hope I enjoy the trampoline, sarcasm at its finest. Fast forword two weeks I tried to order some household items online it went through but shortly after that I received an email saying we are sorry you we had to cancel your order. I called and find out I am blocked from ordering through targets online company. They are the ones that are selling damaged used and returned items. 118.00 down the drain."

Walmart points me to go ""somewhere,"" Target TAKES me there.  They carry quality merchandise instead of trying to stock every item under the sun: I hate overcrowded stores.  The produce is fresh and while they are not meant to be a ""full service"" grocery, what they do carry is usually what I want and need.  I love Target and will always shop there!"

I will now shop online and not with Target, as they do not deserve my custom.  We need to change the culture of no staff and self serving unless for under 5 items.

630,0,"Target is shamefully deceiving there customers into applying for a Red Card, there internal credit card by advertising items available only to Red Card customers.  Upon approval of credit card the item then displays “Out of Stock”.  This is a shameful practice to increase their Red Card applications and deceive customers.  I would then log out of my account and the item would again show the item as available to Red card customers.  I had two other people perform the search on five items that had the Red Card exclusive tag and all five items went unavailable upon Red Card approval.  This is an absolutely shameful practice and it should not be tolerated."
2450,0,BEWARE.... Target cancelled my REDCard with no warning. My card was not expired. They did not contact me saying they were cancelling it. And to top it all off when I called customer service my call was disconnected..TWICE. They will not reactivate it and said I need to apply for another one. I should not have to do that. Not shopping at Target anymore! Signed Unhappy Customer
2395,0,Ordered 2 Christmas trees on Black Friday with free two day shipping. Finally got them 10 days later and they were broken! I’ve spent HOURS on hold with customer service agents. One girl said sorry you need higher up management. He orders me two more trees for free and said I’d have them in two days. That was two weeks ago!! Still no trees. Have called on and made a case number bc I needed a manager again. Now been on chat for TWO HOURS and the second level agent is not sure what to do. OMG! This is so ridiculous! Horrible customer service target!!!
1208,0,"If I could do a negative*I certainly would. When searching online for a product and ordering from target, I was not aware that they deal with third-party affiliates. My merchandise never made it to me and calling their customer service number was a complete nightmare. From foreign speakers who couldn’t understand me to transferring me to affiliates not related to target.com, I spent hours on the phone just to be told that since it was a third-party affiliate that I ordered from on target.com,That they would not be able to send out a replacement all they could do was refund my money back. I am thankful for that, however so much time has passed now I am unable to get a similar product here in time. This experience makes me not want to even deal with target again and if I am given a choice I will not! beware when shopping at fabulous target.com."

The girl stated to me she was going to lunch but someone else would be there to help me when I returned. When I did , there were 4 others besides myself waiting for 15 minutes for an associate so I walked all the way to customer service to ask for help to be sent back, so when I looked down towards electronics noticed some kid finally showed up. As soon as I walked up he said to me I'm not helping you as he proceeded to wait on the other customers not knowing I was 2nd in line there and had been waiting. Also he seen me there earlier purchasing the phone so he knew exactly why I was there and I said you work here don't you, he said I don't have to wait in you if I don't want to, that I have to wait for his mgr to get back from lunch , he said I was acting entitled, I stated to him he was assuming alot and I had already been there waiting , and another customer even stuck up for me and told him that also. He was the rude one and doesn't belong in customer service and I believe his mgr is at fault as well bc she let him get away with his crap. I will never recommend this store, poor customer service, they cannot abuse customers and think we're not going to react. You get what you give!! Lil punks don't need to work for Target or any customer service bc if I was a dude he may have got more than called a name! I also called human resources the next day to report my bad experience with the two employees and they didn't sound surprised, also I called consumer cellular and they are not happy with target representation of them bc they also are spoken to very rudely, I will never be a shopper if Target Corporation!!"
979,0,"Why is it that you can have a sales associate stand at the entrance to make sure customers are wearing masks.  ( basically a mask check as soon as you walk-in the store , followed by an aggressive attitude if you are not wearing it “properly “ ), yet you do not have any sales associates to run the fitting rooms and make sure they are clean? Most if not all other clothing stores have fitting rooms open by now. I understand not having them open at first, but now when other stores do I feel it’s just laziness. Why can you not switch the person being the mask police and utilize them to work the fitting rooms? Customers should not be greeted by an angry mask sales associates  when they walk in the store.   Also if it’s not necessary to wipe down the shopping carts, something that multi customers touch many times throughout the day, Yet it’s unsafe to have to clean dressing rooms, something that not every customer utilizes?  By now everyone knows the mask orders, and do not need to be reminded. Simple as this if customers are in the store without them ask them to leave. On top of this what good does it make sure they are wearing them when they come in? Are you going to follow each customer around the store to make sure they are wearing them?  Very poor management."

My husband is injured and on disability so money is very scarce so to spend $70 on diapers is pushing us to a limit, anyhow yesterday my delivery said it wouldn’t be coming till fri which left me really stuck and not much money to buy more , so worried I called customer service and the woman I spoke to on the phone was vile, she kept cutting me off and wouldn’t let me speak,I was just trying to see if she could help get them here sooner before I ended up In tears  or if I could pick up myself but she wouldn’t even let me speak.she kept repeating over and over it’s an estimated delivery but on my order it didn’t say that, it said will be delivered by weds, I’ve never had this problem before but now I  refuse to shop at any target if that is the kind of people who are working customer service.

1072,0,"We ordered 2 beautiful duvet covers on Dec 1st and we’re very excited to receive them on dec. 8th. We anxiously tracked our order and we’re excited to see that our package was in Salt Lake on the 8th!!! Much to our dismay, however, the package apparently left Salt Lake to go to Vegas that day and it took an additional 2 days to arrive, and that’s when the fun began. We opened our package only to find that not 2, but only 1 Duvet cover was in the package! It was unbelievable to be disappointed in such a manner. We got on the phone immediately with customer service. While they answered promptly we were only left in disappointment as they told us that they couldn’t get us a replacement until Dec. 30th. When we asked what they were going to do to make it right they immediately said there was nothing they can do, so we asked for a supervisor, in hopes that we could get something resolved. When he got on the phone he was firm in that he couldn’t (or wouldn’t) do anything to help or compensate us for this monumental disappointment. These covers are Christmas gifts for our 2 girls, and now we are forced to either buy a lesser cover we don’t really want, or wait until Dec. 30th to not create disappointment in one of our girls. I work in customer service and when something doesn’t go right I ask “what can I do to make it up to you?” And whatever the customer says we do (even if it is a full refund). This guy just didn’t want to help and didn’t seem to care about anyone but himself, and who knows, maybe that is what Target stands for. If they don’t reach out to me after this then I will know the company just doesn’t care about it’s customers and they will have lost not just one customer, but as many from Salt Lake that I can take with me away from them and to a company that actually cares."

Chat support is useless and they suggested I should call their phone number. Im outside the US so making international calls is no option for me and they don't have any emails on their website that I can contact! Finally one time, the chat support was a little bit helpful and they gave me a support email to contact about my issue. I went ahead and emailed them right away hoping for a reply or a reason for cancelling my orders (they accept international cards according to their chat support, so that's not the issue at all). I emailed them more than 3 days ago and now im sure I won't hear back from them at all and the deal that I was interested in ended 2 days ago. What a terrible experience."

1990,0,"I receive countless promotional emails from Target - some for online only offers which is fine. I placed my order online in order to receive the promotional discount for a future order. Order placed, processed and nothing received. I call customer service and told that they can not help. I request to speak with a supervisor and they say I cannot due to it being the holidays. After sitting on hold for over 20 minutes, Target makes it clear that they don’t value their customers and don’t care to adequately address their concerns. I was willing to wait longer to speak with someone who could at least validate the issue but was not allowed to. I also on a separate occasion tried to use a gift card in person and cashier said there was money on the card but the system doesn’t always accept them! Craziness. Instead of calling a manager to resolve, I was told I’d have to go call customer service. The bullseye logo make more sense now. Target runs their customers in a continuous circle with no end point of satisfaction or resolution."

My fiance and I are registered for most of our items at Target, and as people have started sending us gifts they have come in the poorest packaging I have ever seen from a company. Some of the boxes were completely ripped or cut open with large chunks missing. We recently received gifts that were so poorly packaged the gifts themselves were broken into a bunch of tiny pieces. Even after talking to customer service, it was like they had no interest in fixing the problem. Will NEVER register there or recommend to a friend again."

1887,0,"I generally like the look and organization of their actual stores. However, I have bought numerous products (from bedding, to food, to cosmetics) that have been very subpar in quality and I've repeatedly had to return them, which is a hassle. But what's more concerning is that most products on their website have a 5-star rating, which obviously is a case of pick-and-choose of reviews people submit, as I have submitted numerous informative reviews for products myself and they never seem to get published. This tells me they're trying to make their products appear of higher quality than they are, which is why they only publish nothing less than 3 star reviews, but the joke is on them because they keep getting returns on those very same products. This means not only they'll be losing money on all the returned merchandise, but they'll be losing customer trust - like mine - so that we'll turn to other stores to meet our consumer needs. Either make your product review process transparent and honest, and publish ALL reviews, or you're being dishonest and this lack of customer honesty will get spread around on social media (by me, for instance) so that customer satisfaction will continue to decrease.Also, the telephone customer service is HIGHLY unhelpful, most don't even understand basic English, and they never offer to fix a problem, only offer a ""fake"" apology ""for your experience"". Well, no thanks, Target.That's not how it's done, especially in today's highly competitive shopping world."

Each agent I spoke to nicely dismissed me and said I cannot get a refund although I was due to leave the country the next day and they don't want to send who signed for the paclage and where it was left. This was my first time purchasing from Target and believe me, this is the last time. Rest assured, I will be spreading the word far and wide for a boycott."
2142,2,"target is my favorite store of all time, and i shop online regularly.  because of illness i shop target.com more often than i actually go into the store.  the online variety is not exhaustive of every single item in the store, but i always find what i'm looking for.  i buy stuff for my home and most of my clothing.  everything arrives quickly and well-packaged so that nothing is ever damaged.  i have a subscription delivery which means i don't ever have to think about ordering those things because they arrive like clock work.  i couldn't ask for more."

1040,0,Over priced. Item on shelves not priced or just thrown in another item section with misleading price. Small quantities highly overpriced. No cart returns me in lot. Easy return policy is why I gave it a 1. Groceries section fresh foods gross. Walmart much better value for same crap.
631,0,Don't buy Garden products from Target.I bought a Broadcast spreader that doesn't work. They will not take back or give credit . Just said Too bad .Terrible experience
1433,0,"Target has the best on-line ordering and delivery solution.  The delivery service and often pricing are better than Amazon.  They appear to have some issue with out of stock items, but I have not experienced that issue.It is the shipping/delivery service that I think Target really shines.  The emails you get with the status of your purchase shines in comparison to Amazon.  For example, in an Amazon email notifying you of a pending delivery you get the tracking number but no indication of what product is being shipped, whereas Target provides all information in one email.  Same is true for notification of delivery where target provides everything you need to know in the email and does not require you to click a link to go back to the website.I do use Amazon but I look first to Target to buy what I can from them."

2406,0,"Recently, I have been shopping at Target (East in Colorado Springs) after work in the evening. Each time, there was only ONE cashier and  TWO self-check-out stations open. There were long lines of people waiting to pay for their purchases  -- up to 9 people in line. This week, I waited in the self-check-out line for 10 minutes. After I checked my 22 items, I was told that Target didn't accept checks in the self-check-out line. This was not posted anywhere!(Other stores accept checks in the self-check-out line.)Each time that I have shopped at Target in the evening, it took me 30-40 minutes to check out... Even though I like the products that Target sells, I am too tired, after working all day, to spend that kind of time checking out at Target.I will go back to shopping at King Soopers after work. Their managers monitor the cash registers and the lines -- in and out in no more than 10-15 minutes!Sorry Target, frustrating shoppers is not a good business model. Especially when they are waiting to give you their money!"

2573,0,Online purchases are a joke. They won't cancel my order that was delayed even though it isn't ready for shipping and last year I had a damaged shirt come in and they told me it was out of stock and returned a whole 25 cents to me. Reordered the same shirt about 10 mins later and then they returned $2 In store credit....thanks for that....payed shipping twice and has 2 would-be identical shirts if not for the damage.

505,0,"I'm only writing it negative to bring attention to a UNREASONABLE PACKAGING WASTE the company causes. As one of the leading retailers you are in place to set standards and make a difference.

I had noticed nothing posted to my bank account, and found the payment had been returned.  I immediately corrected the error and called to let them know what happened.  I explained the situation and asked the returned payment to be removed.  I was greeted with a particularly rude attitude, and since “Target” didn’t make a mistake there was nothing they could do.  When I made the payment, there wasn’t a payment due."

Thank goodness the order that I was charged for, but never left the facility was only $24 and change.  Customer service was useless, once I finally got someone to answer (4 phone calls over 5 days the key was to put it on speaker and be willing to wait 30 minutes to get someone to anser).  They kept saying that they would reauthorize the shipment and I would receive Wednesday the same thing that was supposed to be delivered on Dec. 3 and it would charge my card when shipped, but they already charged my card for the first time it was suppose to ship. When I asked to soeak with someone who understood my question anout charging for something I had already charged for she put me on hold again, I hung up after 5 minutes of waiting.  Very disappointed.."

Now we are trying to figure out where our furniture is that we ordered and absolutely no help at all from customer service, wondering if they will even refund or replace my missing items…? Absolutely ridiculous!! Constantly cancel our in store pick up orders and won’t give any reason. I don’t recommend this business at all and this used to be my favorite store 🤦‍♀️"

I reached out to Customer Service and they asked me to create a new account to continue placing the orders. Really some cheap tactics to increase the customer accounts registered.Another heights of stupidity - while writing this review they ask to add images for proof and when I try the link doesn't work,"
844,0,"Since the pandemic I've been using the delivery service and purchasing from Target more. I've also had more time to pay attention to the quality of products. The quality control is low and the return process is time consuming. I feel taken advantage of, this company takes your money in exchange for products that are low quality and defective. I have many friends who have worked for this company, they treat employees poorly. I have continued to purchase items I want or need because they are affordable, however I'm beginning to realize it's essentially a scam. Please stop giving them your business."

590,2,"Complaint against Target at 4795 W Irlo Bronson Memorial HwyKissimmee, FL  34746Its unbelievable that Target supports discrimination of any kind!!! Their store announcement goes somewhat like this- “only unvaccinated ppl must wear masks”.  ???  There is No science, data or Facts that back up their store announcement against people who have chosen for GOOD REASONS to Not receive the COVID-19 vaccine.  Since(speaking of facts)- 1) the vaccine doesn’t protect Anyone anyway: FACT.  2) this vaccine has severe adverse side effects for some: FACT!!!!3) vaccinated ppl can Unknowingly spread the virus: FACT((per Lord Fauci’s statements himself))4) Unvaccinated people have natural antibodies after getting covid: FACT.  5) this f-ing man-made virus has a 98.6% rate of survival if Anyone healthy gets it: FACT! 6)  and just a tip; There are treatments and medicines and prophylactics available by doctors who know that they should give them: FACT!!   Other FACTS to consider-  Have we not learned from Nazi Germany when they brainwashed the german people to hate the jews and other political dissidents??  And did we not learn from our own American Segregation Era when the same type of politicians were saying that black people had diseases and must be separated??!!  This is SICK propaganda and rhetoric  meant to divide and destroy!!!!! I could go on..  To make derogatory statements against the unvaccinated is discrimination and is against the law!!!!!"
754,0,Bessemer AL Target showed online that an item was available. I ordered and paid online. I drove 27 miles same day to pick up and discovered the item had never been available and a substitution was made which was of no use to me. I could only get a store credit (gift card) that day! I also found out that substitution is encouraged in order to make their “numbers” look better. Poor judgement on management’s part and a definite disregard for customer satisfaction.

2090,0,"Ordered a TV on October 6th with a 2 day (unguaranteed) delivery. Received a message every 2 days from Target indicating it was delayed by two days. After 6 messages I called customer support four times to try to find out what was happening. Each time I was assured the TV was on the way. On the third call Target support told me my TV was being shipped and suggested I call the shipping company for a schedule. I called the shipping company and they indicated that they had not yet received the package from Target. It is now two weeks since I placed the order and I am still waiting for my TV. I suspect that Target two day delivery is really two month delivery. In the world of Amazon, Target may be in trouble."

1610,0,The Honey pot advert is racist!!  If it was a white blond lady saying I want a bright future for all little white girls it wouldn’t be allowed and there would be an uproar about it!!

1186,0,"I just moved into an apartment spent about 700 in store with target blankets, sheets,shower curtain, everything bathroom related. I also order a TV stand from target online which thanks to FedEx I had to track down cause it was lost in shipping, finally get it and a piece is damaged. Target's answer is to pack up all 30ish pieces ship it back and wait for another one. So take up more of my time. I was offered a 20% discount. I had to make several phone calls to both target and FedEx about two hours of my time. I am supposed to be willing to invest more of my time to pack things up to return it wait for a second one unpack that one again my TIME IS WORTH MORE THEN 20% OF A 271 DOLLAR ITEM. 54 dollar which is about 20% is about what i make for an hour and a half of work."

933,0,"We were robbed 4,000.00 through the target gift cards set up. Apparently someone from the store is stimulating gift cards sales and immediately cash them through the store. Despite numerous attempts Target refuse to cooperate into investigating the issues under the disguise of consumer confidentiality. Which led me to believe that it’s an inside job. BEWARE OF TARGET GIFT CARDS SCAMS"

I received my Amazon game the same day! I also got a refund for 10.68 from Amazon because they said the price had gone down. When I called Target Customer Service, I spoke with Trish. All she would tell me is the game was shipped and I would receive on Thursday 3/26, almost a full week after release. She stated she couldn’t do anything about the price, she told me if I wanted to order from Amazon that I could return the game to Target! So much for customer service! I asked to speak to a supervisor, was told hold, which I did, for about 7 minutes, then I was hung up on!! Is this how all of Target’s customer service representatives are trained? I guess I will shop Amazon next time instead of Target!"

She gave no options or alternatives, Just that it could not be returned, Sorry. WT#! THEIR NAME & BAR CODE RIGHT ON THE PACKAGE!!!! She didn't even make an attempt to find it in the system.

2598,0,2 days ago I purchased a 200 dollar vacuum from target. When I got home I open the box to find the wrong vacuum was in the box not only was it wrong but it was used. So I went back to target to return the item. I had my receipt I just bought it so what’s the problem. Well the manager of the store told me it had to be approved by head quarters to be returned as it’s the wrong ok. Ok why when I bought it from here. Anyways I call head quarters right from the store as the manger walked away from me and head quarters said well did they try to process the return I said i dont know I am here now and no one will even speak to me. I finally got the manager back over and the manager spoke to head quarters and they decided it was at the discretion of the store. What this is ridiculous I just bought this item. Now mind u I am 9 months pregnant pulling around this vacuum that target sold me but refused to take back. I will never shop here again shame on you target.
2339,0,"Nightmare Customer Service Tried returning a few online purchased items with receipt-Town Center Jax-and I am right back home with them. No returns, exchanges or anything with receipt?! Three staff including a couple of managers cannot do anything with boxed unopened with receipt items. What a hassle. It does not make any sense. I had a very frustrating experience right before Christmas as well with online Target. I’d accidentally cancelled an order and re-added it, so I called to make sure I only get one item and ten minutes later someone just hung up without even answering. I tried their chat and provided them with all the info and sure enough a week later I got 2 of the exact same 500lb tables. If they don’t have time for me, I don’t have time for them either. Frustrating and time wasting experience."
2570,0,Target charges alot of money for poor quality items. My husband bought a 30 shorts. Thin and flimsy. I told my husband that you never pay full price at Kohl's.  Going to do our shopping at Kohl's. I bought a movie on black Friday and the employee didn't remove the hard tag. I actually didn't see it til I went to wrap it for a gift. Of course the lady treated me like a stole it. I had the receipt. She should have treated me better. Won't shop at any Target
1270,0,"Shipping from target is plan awful.  I have placed 2 orders so far.  The first order had the whole package lost somewhere.  Kept being told to wait till the package arrives since the tracking said it would be delivered today...day after day after day...  UPS said that it was marked as on the truck, but the driver always says it is not there, and only target can issue a trace on the package.  They finally replaced the items after several calls to them.  The delivery of that package was scheduled to take longer than the first (a week).  When it came one of the two boxes was trashed.  They don't use any filler and the boxes break apart.  I am still waiting for the item that apparently fell out of the broken box to arrive.  I have placed another order.  So far 1/2 of the order arrived over the weekend - the box was trashed, but all was usable, but dented.  The other 1/2 of the order did not come in time, and I have received an email from FEDEX that it is being shipped back to Target due to damage.  They just throw loose items into a box that is oversized with no padding and expect that things will get there in ok shape.  Clearly they don't know how to pack things.  So now I wait and see how long till I get those items."

He told me also, that it wd be just a few minutes for help to assist me in buying the chair. I tnked him & waited . And waited, and waited 40 minutes total & noone came at all!  I was very patient, didnt complain, yell, or do anything because i believed ( stupidly) that i wd get help!  So i in frustration, i saw a younger guy stocking shelves nearby & told him of my problem,he went & got a device to put the floor sample on it & said that it was the last one left, so he helped me wheel it to the customer service  area , it was 45 minutes total by now but i was so happy finally that he helped me!  I spoke  to the nice cashier & she looked it up & found that the sale was off already & it ws the regular price. I tnked her & told her it was way too long for me to find out it was no longer on sale.  I was told i wd have to pay full price for the floor model w stains on it. I declined the chair. I got a comp card but  i dont feel i. Should of had to wait a total of 40 minutes w 2 managers telling me it wd only be a few minutes & also find out it was not on sale anymore!  Leaves a sour taste in future purchases for shopping at Target!  Cant believe even the managers lie to you & not incontrol of ppl that wd gv me a few minutes to help me even if i found out the chair was not on sale!  No one should hv to wait that long for help!

I ran down there immediately only to be told that indeed it was in stock but I would have to return at opening the next day.

Then two times in a row I ordered from one store that I know carries my products and the shopper showed a different store location on the shipt app. A location that carries none of my products. And, today, the shopper cancelled my whole order. I messaged shipt & they tell me to call Target. Target wants me to re-enter the entire 90+ item order and says there is nothing else they can do.

This information was absolutely false as this package was never re-delivered to my location.So much wasted time and energy on a simple 1 item orderI shopped at my local Target store  on 10/29 to purchase new bath sheets and wash clothes- the brand I selected had sale promotion signs on every shelf 25% off with no exceptions listed.I was excited to save 25%. I get home and look at my receipt only to see that one of the colors that I selected in the bath sheets and wash clothes was charged at regular price - so irritating and frustratingI look online to see if this color was not part of the promotion only to find the bath sheets and wash clothes are all on sale for 30% off- so the stores and .com don't even have a seamless process to offer the same pricing and promotions in store and online- I decide to order the exact same bath sheets and wash clothes online to take advantage of the lower prices and I will return the other sets to the store. The online order was suppose to be 2 day shipment of which of course is not. I track the shipment on 11/1 as it was due to deliver on 10/31. Only to find out the shipment is undeliverable due to a bad address- Bad Address SERIOUSLY- I need to contact the sender. In 2 attempts to chat with the useless online support to cancel the order I had one rep end the chat session and the other said he was unable to assist and directed me to call back the next day during business hours- again INCOMPETENT why have a chat if you can't assist customers- The customer service contact information is so hidden on the website and app that you have to search thru multiple clicks to find it - who hides CS contact info- My advise don't waste your time, energy or money with Target - there are so many other retailers who deliver as promised and offer immediate service resolution should a problem arise after you have paid for their products/shipping.

I can absolutely say once I run out of honey pot products I run to target immediately to stock up on more, and to be truthful that’s one of the only reasons I shop at target. I have introduced all the women in my whole family to honey pot and they LOVE that we have a brand that’s specially made for women !!! Chemical free, natural, and great for sensitive skin , it doesn’t get better than that. I love this product line and everything they stand for . I ESPECIALLY love the commercial. I think target did a great job in the direction they are moving with honey pot . WE STAN honey pot. As long as you have a place on your shelves for honey pot products you will have a life long customer along with the rest of her family and friends. WE LOVE HONEY POT !!!"
2386,0,I honestly wouldn't give it even a one star! Target advertised an arrival date of the 21st of December before I purchased the item. This was one of the biggest reasons why I purchased it from them in the first place. Checked the tracking and it won't be here till the 27th -.- Now I don't have a Christmas present for my niece. Spent over 3 hours on the phone talking to 5 different agents just to be told they can't do anything about it. Horrible service! NEVER BUY FROM TARGET ONLINE! Always buy in store with them!

I feel like if you don't like certain people you should not work in public i cry eveyday because she really hurt my feeling and target was my favorite store but it's not anymore and i also tell all my friends and family about how she destroyed my shopping experience and made me change who i spend my hardworking money with .

The employees doing the stocking had a huge cart in an aisle and was blocking customer access not only to product but also you couldnt get by them.

The store:  Overton Ridge in Fort Worth, Texas.  Impossible to rectify by phone.  No phones were being answered in any department.  This store has a history of stocking expired dairy."

1601,0,"I'm here, as a white person, to show my support for Target and The Honey Pot and am horrified by the racism I see in other reviews. Over the years, MANY products have been about empowering white people, even if no one came out and said it. Empowering black women isn't racist; it's a welcome effort toward making up for the countless opportunities for black women that racism has stolen in this country. It's sickening to see that so many white people want all the power all the time!"

Ordered cameras online with 2 free film packs, and used 20% off coupon.   Received camera but promo film missing. Customer no-service tells me  to return and re-order  and maybe film will come next time but I lose the 20% off.  Wouldn’t accommodate.  Just awful!!!! no wonder amazon is kicking retailers butts!"
1023,0,"I have only used Target.com twice in my entire life and both occasions have been disasters. The first time was to order a laptop that had gone on sale. They sent me an email saying it was on its way. Three days later the tracking info said it was pending. Four days later (on what should have been the initial delivery date), it still stated pending. Two weeks later the order had been canceled but there was no signs of a refund that had been sent. They say they sent it and my bank statement says otherwise. The second time was this Christmas. I ordered a gift for my daughter and, after 10 days of waiting, I called and asked why my package is still posted as the delivery date being Dec 21st and it now being the 23rd. The customer service representative told me.that the package showed no movement and was still in the store. IT NEVER LEFT THE STORE! Fricking amazing! I thought Target was a dependable store but I wouldn't trust them to deliver cold weather in the winter at this point. I'll stick with Walmart.com from now on. At least they've never disappointed me."

1057,0,"Nursing supervisor WORST Customer Service EVER!I ordered gift cards for my staff to be shipped so I did not have to go into store. When I placed the order was told 3-5 business days. My calculations we are now 11 days since I ordered them. They email a tracking number that is ""invalid"" so I tonight I reached out to check on the status. First attempted the chat feature; Elima said nothing they can do contact the gift card line...is it bad enough that Target has their own line for gift card complaints? So I call, was ""assigned"" a case number and was going to be transferred to second tier.  Nope, she hung up on me. I called back and despite the fact she gave a different name it sounded like the same woman. She told me gift cards are never guaranteed or refundable and they never put a tracking number on them. Oh yeah, our turn around time for gift cards is 21 days not 3-5.  She again was going to transfer me and hung up. The third time, still sounds like the exact same woman in a matter of 5 minutes. I give her my case number and she said the second tier closed at 6:00 and there is no one there to help me. I need to call back during normal business hours and hung up.I have been a loyal customer for years and through all of COVID using their grocery service (they are 2 miles from my home) and most of my Christmas shopping...again including a unit full of nurses who have busted their tails for patients in the last 9 months. They will not credit me, refused to offer any type of service recovery. They could in the least credit my account to let me actually go to the store and pick them up. Only if I want to dish out the few hundred dollars I have already spent on the.  I will go elsewhere moving forward. Target has lost me as a customer forever.  I know they could careless but enough people say enough is enough maybe they will open their eyes."

1516,0,"First off, it surely works.  I told it to look only for stock in my local Target store, bought stuff putting in a cart (always mentioning it was for drive-up), it remembered over the course of days, then paid for it.  Then it has a button to hit when you start driving over and then another when you arrive in the special spot by the door.  She came out and put it in the trunk of my car.  Leave it for 2 or 3 days in car, if you are worried (as you should be) and then you have ZERO chance of getting sick.  It is great for all to use.  I hope they do well with this FREE Drive-up feature.  I loved it so much I just had to put this in.  The only thing I gained from this is trust from my kids that I did not go near anybody as I could get really sick."

2480,0,"Target was my store. For many years, was store with good customer service all year around,  now target is  like  Walmart, u cannt ask question to the workers they act like deaft or they got actitud , they don’t want the customer bother them,  I live in plantation, and every time. I go  to target is a problem,  you cannt ask question, you need help nobody cannt help you, cause they ignore you. Today. I was there  and definetly I don’t go back.  They treat people bad and people overseas that come to target to buy a l lot to resale in their countries forget it  it’s worst.  It’s very sad but I decide to complaint after  so many disappointments.  Target is getting worst than Walmart , it used to be. Nice and good environment store,  thank you and I hope my beautiful and nice prestige target come back again."

So I am never going to shop at targets again…After 6 months of trying I finally got to order the new Xbox series X and twice they said oh sorry the item is not available but they charged the card! So whatever but this time on the second go when I found it available (searching the stupid app all the time!) they canceled my order. I called customer service, the girl was rude and cut me off saying she is the highest level of support and no resolution. So to summarize this horrible experience. For the rest of my life in this system I refused to have anything to do with this company known as Target!"
2399,0,If i could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered a special cabinet with 2 day shipping and of course I am still sitting here day 6 no cabinet. I contacted customer service and they said well according to our records this is where your cabinet is currently located...they preceded to give me the location according to UPS. I knew all that- They need to stop false advertising the 2day shipping- Worst customer experience ever!
2207,0,"I ordered an item online for $40. The next morning I get an e mailing saying it was cancelled due to a pricing error in their end. If the item were lower they would ship it, but because it was higher they were cancelling the order. It said I could reorder the item from the order details page. I called and was told this pricing error was a known issue and when I said the store should honor the price they advertised as any other store would I was told the item was no longer available to order online they removed it so no one else could order at that price. I then asked the rep if she would  speak to someone about honoring the price; about 10 minutes later she came back and said her supervisor said this pricing error is a known issue (well we all knew that already) and then said  the item was no longer available hmmm vs no longer online anymore as she said that 10 minutes before . She could give me a 20% discount if the item every was available again. When I asked what the correct pricing was she wasn't sure, but they go for about $170 - nay don't think so. I told her the 20% isn't doing anything and she offered the corporate phone umber for me to call and complain. When I asked when they were available she said standard time and I asked what days and she said she didn't know. Pathetic service and excuse."

All they do is send me advertising. As I researched this, it appears to be a design flaw that they ARE aware exists. I finally purchased a Mr. Coffee 12 cup carafe and corrected the problem myself. All I wanted was a response from Keurig, and got none. Will never purchase their products again."

316,0,Be careful when doing business with the NE side store in Cedar Rapids IA. They make thier own rules in regards to the contracts when you go in to pick up. idc if it was a PS5 or something else. they said in the email there would be no problems with me picking up the order my mom placed for my son. Got there & they refused to let me pick it up. My 78 year old mother had to drive in 30 miles on crappy roads so they could get her id. It clearly stated on the email that she would be notified when it was picked up & I was authorized to pick it up. The manager was so rude actually rolled her eyes at me. My son has autism they got him so upset he started tearing up. Yes horrible customer service & no regards for the customer is always right. How pathetic - Target you have really disappointed us :/
78,0,"Ordered a patio set via Target.com from manufacturer Tangkula. Product showed up without hardware. Prethreaded and requires a variety of stainless steel metric bolt which are impossible to find entirely locally. Response from Tangkula to Target was slow so tried reaching out by phone and email to Tangkula directly who never responded. Tangkula initially said to check boxes for hardware (duh!). Finally got back a week later that they do not have replacement hardware.I had to load all this stuff back into my car to get it back to a target store, packing my car to the gills. To add insult to injury, when I got to target, because I couldn’t see anything out the passenger windows I grazed a truck tire that was jutting out over the parking line. Will probably cost about as much as the patio set to repair. Not targets fault, but never would have happened if Tangkula had any level of competent customer service. Target was great about promptly refunding the purchase but they hid the review on the item on their website. Shady.DO NOT BUY TANGKULA. DO NOT BUY THIRD PARTY FURNITURE FROM TARGET."
1411,0,"Thanks Target. I have never had any issue with anything at Target and I’ve shopped at Target for over 20 years and in several different states. I use order pick up, order online and ship it to another state and I have never had any problems. You may be short on cleaning supplies and paper products, but, so is everyone else. I completely understand that the people who make these products have been ordered to stay at home just like the rest of us and it is going to take along time for things to get built back up, these companies have a lot of ground to cover And I’m sure that when they get back to work they will do their best just like the rest of us. Keep up the good work and know that Target is my happy place."
1832,0,"I ordered a set of canning jars and received a damaged box.  I figured that was a one time though painful process.  Wrong.  I ordered much later several containers if pet friendly ice melt and a sweater.  Leaving out several levels of problems and communications, the really awful parts are that the shipment was damaged from the start which, kudos, was communicated.  Delivery was not made, damaged or corrected. And no contact was made from target though I was charged.  After several calls and replacement by me if the items from other suppliers, I requested a refund.  They dud not refund.  They reordered, and eventually I discovered that they refunded part if the order that included the sweater and 1 container of ice melt, but redelivered only the 3 container box that was damaged.  I brought it inside and my home was immediately filled with leaking ice melt Crystal's.  The only good news. I was eventually told the damaged shipment would be refunded and I didn't have to go to the trouble of refund shipment.  Of course not.  They didn't want to clean up the mess.  Don't shop here."
2276,0,I placed an order online  04/09/2019 at 7:24 that morning. I received an tracking number for UPS on 04/09/2019 at 3:05 that afternoon. At the time I placed my order you all stated 2 day shipping. On 04/10/2019 I began  tracking the package which was only showing that a label was printed but the Target website was showing delivery date of 04/11/2019. I check again for the location of the package on 04/11/2019  and it was still showing label printed but it was not in route. I called UPS thinking maybe it was a system issue and was informed that Target NEVER sent the notification for them to pick up. I called Target and was instantly given the run around. I was informed by a rep with Target that the package is not suppose to be delivered until 04/11/2019 which was the same day I called trying to check status after speaking to UPS. This rep was very rude so i asked for an manager. I was informed by the rep that her manager do not take any calls with customers. I asked for a supervisor and was placed on hold for almost 20 minutes. A guy by the name of Jessie S. picked up the line and I began explaining the reason for the call. He informed me it was noting he could due that I can't get a  refund due to the status of the package and I  should wait because the delivery date  in Target system shows  04/11/2019. I called back to Target that  afternoon due to the package still not showing movement. I was told it's noting Target could due for me and it's probably an system issue with UPS. Informed the rep that I've already spoke to UPS was placed on hold again and also transferred. I was told over and  over again it was noting Target could  do  for me but Target had my money as well as their  product. I was informed by two different reps that a manager will call me back (NEVER RECEIVED A CALL). I explained to many reps how urgent  it was for my niece to get this item for her college class that she would fail without it. I was offered a Target gift card as a refund because that's all they could do.A Target gift card WASN'T going to help me with the issue I was having with a company that I already spent money with and they couldn't  assist me with resolving the problem. Target was offering to give me a gift card that i would be forced to use with them again(poor customer service).  This morning(04/12/2019) I called Target again due to the package still showing that a label was printed but no movement.  I was FORCED to request a refund and wait 7 days to receive my refund. I went 3 days if hell just for my niece to still be in need of a lab top for college and for me to have to wait to purchase her once due to Target poor customer service and negotiate.  I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS with TARGET again. Received a voicemail saying the package is  lost and the carrier never received  🤦🏽‍♀️

If it had another date I would have done the same day delivery due to the fact the baby shower was on June 1st. When I called the so called supervisor said I should try an alternative> I stated what alternative you do not have any of the products in your store that she had on her registry. Then I stated I would have done the over night if I would have known the date was wrong. She then stated they don't offer that. I said then you need to change your website and you need to put different dates when people order from you. She said it doesn't say guarantee I said well it doesn't say any other dates either. It just said the date it would be here, Then I spoke with someone else a friend of mine and she stated that she has been waiting for 3 weeks for her delivery from Target. Very poor customer service and very poor delivery info they give you. I order a product from amazon for the same dates the free delivery stated 31st-4th so i chose to pay the extra 30 for it to come on the 31st and guess what it did. I would have never would have chose the 31st through target if I knew it was not going to be at me house,"
952,0,"Target is a great place to shop with an exceptional return policy and stellar employees.  5-star establishment.  Had to rate 4 stars because of their shipping.  I noticed this shortly after obtaining a RedCard, long before COVID (so it's not the excuse for everything!), but seems like it's getting worse.  Why on earth do you offer free 2-day shipping an option?!  Nothing arrives in 2 days - more like 5-7 or even longer?  It would take me less time to drive to a different store on the other side of town than to wait so long for items that are promised 2-day shipping when the order is placed.  And please don't tell me that Target and Target.com are 2 different businesses.  🙄"
773,0,I always loved target until recently. I had a baby shower and used baby list so that my friends and family could chose where they ordered from. Target flat out refused to accept returns on items that had been unopened with a target shipping label on the box. Clearly the items came from their warehouse. I didn’t even want a refund. Just credit so I could purchase other things I need. They said they needed a receipt. I didn’t feel comfortable asking gift givers for receipts so I really lost out. I have since stopped shopping there.
103,0,"Why target had to act like I steal something from their store? It’s because of how I dress? I don’t get why that lady came out of nowhere and check my bag while I was check out the items. I thought, she probably gonna help I remove the security tag but my daughter still had her security tag on without taking it out by any employee. One of the pant didn’t have a tag hang on the it but it was in the pocket, so I just use that tag but I been told that it’s not the real one. After checking out, she ask me to check the bucket but it was empty. Target’s employee need to do a better job on organized their products. Don’t just leave anything as it is and act like someone is stealing something from them. I never had this disrespectful service before. The day before, I bought something at target app that cost $97 but charged me $120. So I contact customer service and they blame on my bank. Better check your account after buying something from target app. Disrespectful service and bad organization."

NOW MY DISLIKE FOR THIS COMPANY IS BEING REINFORCED TENFOLD DUE TO THE HIGHLY OFFENSIVE COMMERCIAL FOR HONEYPOT PRODUCTS SOLD AT TARGET. THE COMMERCIAL IS EXTREMELY RACIST AND SUPPORTS ONLY BLACK WOMEN, AND I AM HIGHLY OFFENDED BY THIS AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING THERE.

501,0,I had a interview with target and they showed up 30 min late! That is just a perfect way to make someone feel like you don’t respect there time or effort coming to want to work for you guys. As I sat there waiting I already made my decision that I didn’t wanna work for them how unprofessional! You guys need to realize you are trying to hire me also if I showed up 30 min late I wouldn’t get the job. Just completely made me feel like I had wasted my time with the video orientation you have to do before having an actual meet and great. Just super disappointed…

1546,0,"Do NOT do your Christmas shopping at TargetSo after MONTHS of trying to get a resolution to a broken item that we purchased for Christmas at the Fishers, IN Target leadership has just IGNORED my requests for assistance. We purchased a PS4 and a VR set from Target for Christmas along with several other items to the tune of over $1500 in November 2019. As you know on Christmas day it's always a big deal to the recipient to be able to hook it all up and play everything. During our set up we found that the VR Headset was not in new condition. The silicone wrap around it was torn and about 90% of the way off the headset. This caused it to slip and not fit correctly. When we reached out to Target, they would not exchange it because they no longer had the same set we purchased. They obviously knew they purchased a set few for the Christmas season but didn't bother telling consumers that if there was anything wrong with it there would be NO exchanges allowed after Christmas. After being tossed around to several different employees and then finally a manager they agreed to exchange for another set but we had to return the VR games as well. Well we couldn't really do that since it was a digital download and it all had already been downloaded. So they then said sorry you're out of luck. After over a month we were finally able to get Playstation to replace the VR headset but not without a lot of back and forth so while this was going on it was almost February before we had a useable VR headset. In the interim, I reached out to Target Leadership back at the beginning of January and as of today March 16th NONE of them responded. Just goes to show they could care less about someone who has been a long time customer (25+ years). They won't have to worry about me ever stepping foot in their store again regardless of what their advertised specials are since I now know the game they play. We purchase a few items and make them Black Friday specials with the intent to not carry them after Black Friday so we don't have to honor the exchange policy. Very bad business... If you are going to sell a product then you should be on the hook if the box was pre-opened or parts are damaged. We as a consumer are trusting that's what in the box is what is represented to us and wouldn't know otherwise. I've since been told that when things come back as broken, etc. not all the employees even bother to look in the box and they end up back on the shelves for someone else to buy a broken or damaged item. This is a terrible business practice and it's definitely lost me as a customer."

I completely understand why so many Target stores are closing now. Whomever is the one creating the refund policies is making a huge mistake and it’s in Targets best interest to get rid of him and find someone who knows customer service. I purchased an air mattress. It wouldn’t stay inflated. I took it back and they didn’t have the one I needed. I was going to get a refund and go to another store and purchase the one I needed. I couldn’t get a refund, even though I had a defective product. That’s isn’t good customer service. They’re attempting to hold on to every penny they can by making the customer suffer.

I was never greeted or even acknowledged by the CS person, because she was too busy having a personal conversation with another employee. She returned one item, and said the second item was not on my receipt or even in their inventory. She talked to 3 people, and after 15 min. Of waiting around and each other and making their own conclusions, a second woman stated I never purchased the pants there. I asked how she came to that conclusion, and she stated she had checked the cameras. I question her seeing the pants on camera, and she stated she never did. That the cashier careful placed all items in my bag, including an item I never purchased, but rather price checked. The so called manager walked off, and left me talking after attempting to resolve this issue and understand how she would not see the items I purchased so clearly, except for the item I wanted to return. I did not take the item without paying for it, and I never shop at any other target store. I will no longer do business with you, after experiencing a handful of worthless employees who degraded me and disrespected me by sarcastically wishing me a good day and laughing at me on my way out the door."
2314,0,"So I purchased two items online to be picked up in the store.  I looked at the stores closest to me; it was listed as available at one and not at the other.  I completed my purchase and planned to pick up at the location where my items were listed as available.  When I arrive, I wait on line only to be told that I should check my inbox for another email canceling my order.  I obviously found this ridiculous and when I asked how this could happen, the “customer service rep” told me that the “corporate office does not update inventory as frequently as they should” and then suggests that I should always continue to check my email when I purchase online for store pick up because this “happens all the time.” Simply amazing!"
882,0,I love Target because I can get what I need at a really good price. I am able to find things easily. And also their employees are really nice and friendly. I would definitley recommend Target to everyone.
1836,0,"Based on order 1065757078475. The website showed 4 containers of Byotrol24 - they were marked available! I ordered, the payment went through, THEN a few days later there was a back order. ONE container was sent with 4 containers of Clorox Bleach. I chatted with a service rep named ""ROBERT"" who offered a gift card for the inconvenience. The Byotrol24 and 3 containers of Clorox were  delivered. Despite the fact that Target somehow marked the other items as back ordered Robert helped me out by making it right the best that he could. Thank you Robert for being patient and helpful! I give Robert 5 starts but Target 3 starts for listing a product as being available then removing it after my order processed. But, I will say my customer service experience was excellent!"
2102,0,"Terrible gift card system! I was charged for an electronic card and the gift although sent from their end the email was not received on the other end. I called the guest services ( gift card line) and although it was a very specific customer service line it was clear that the representatives were not properly trained to assist with card related issues and concerns. They did not understand how the e gift card service worked.I will say that the  representatives were kind but honestly they could not answer my questions instead were very rehearsed and they weren’t  speaking in an authentic manner ( but answering me with scripted responses)and weren’t  able to address very specific concerns. My debit card was charged but the intended recipient never received the gift ( not in junk spam ,promotions etc), so I wanted the girt card canceled and resent -that was an ORDEALLLLLLL!!! Will not be purchasing gift cards from target again."
2535,0,I was told by a manager to go buy a TV at Walmart. All I was asking was to hold the online purchase for 1 extra day. They were unable to accommodate this simple request.
190,0,Target stinks. The products are overpriced and poor quality. Most importantly they are erasing the innocence of children by promoting hypersexualized clothing.
216,0,"Several months ago I joined the Target Redcard Program because it offered 5% cashback and free shipping on many items without having to meet the $35 minimum otherwise required. I've only been able to order one time where I got free shipping without having to spend $35. Again, today when I ordered, all items met the requirements of the program but I but I did not get free shipping nor did I get the correct amount of cashback. All items that I selected say in the description very clearly that it's free shipping with Red card or a $35 minimum without. This is a very difficult and frustrating company to deal with."
1857,0,"Today around my lunch break, I decided to walk to target to grab Starbucks. Once I purchased my items from the Starbucks inside I decided to buy tit tacs but then changed my mind, I put the item back. Right as I was walking out one of the store workers chased me down and accused me of stealing a 2.29 tit tac box all because I was African American. I’ve never been racially profiled before nor have I ever experienced this before. I love target it’s my number one store but I WONT be going to this target ever again. Not all African Americans steal , keep in mind that some of us were raised on respect and dignity. I can’t help the color of my skin nor can I help the family I was born in."
879,0,"They listed an item as available for delivery to my zip code on the site. Once my account was created and credit card added, the site said the item cannot be delivered and is not available at the nearest location. Now to deactivate my account, I have to call Customer Service and berate someone that makes minimum wage and is told to refuse to deactivate accounts."
2364,0,Wow I’m appalled on how target works now it’s not a legal thing but you can’t even pay with a gift card to buy a gift card that’s very irritating and frankly stupid I won’t be shopping there again
302,0,I experienced attempting to make a purchase with no one present to pay.  There was ONE cashier and 4 self service cash registers.  There were 2 lines that stretched midway the isle for check out.  I left my basket in the isle.  I will not wait in line for a store that will not hire cashiers to pay for products.  What kind of store does that? its not fair to the customers and it is certainly not fair to the ONE cashier that was trying to do his level best of being OVERWORKED!!!
1118,0,Ordered a nice shiny ice blue kitchenaid stand mixer ... they stated on the order that it would be delivered 11/27 and that it would be in the original packaging... (which is not ideal but I get why companies are doing that to reduce waste etc but is horrible having packages on the porch visible to all) ...  Because knowing this item would be sitting on my porch exposed I rearranged my work schedule to purposefully be home on the day of delivery.   I work out of town so this wasn't an easy task.  Imagine my surprise when I receive an email notification that my stand mixer was delivered around noon on 11/25.   The fact that they don't notify customers that packages are coming early is absolutely ridiculous and just poor customer service for so many reasons.  At the VERY LEAST... VERY LEAST they can do is send an email updating the delivery date so that I could have worked with them to change that date or at try and get a neighbor to look out for it.   This is just horrible and easily avoided customer abrasion.   Now I have to worry about someone stealing it off my porch... and worse my wife (who has been wanting a new mixer forever) will now see her gift when she comes home from work.   Just a horrible customer service experience from something that other companies do on a regular basis and something that is so easily fixable.   I'll take my money elsewhere from now on and even pay a little more.  If my item is missing from my front porch I can only imagine what kind of headaches that brings with trying to resolve with Target.. but also my wife will see her present if I cant find a neighbor to grab it beforehand.   How does Target not have people making decisions that could see issues like these coming and take action to reduce potential customer abrasion proactively.   This is a horrible user experience... and completely avoidable.   DO BETTER Target.  DO BETTER.
1556,0,Typical online target....order something then a week later they send you an email they can't get the product.  So sick of it.  Walmart is the way to go...they fulfill their promises on product. Shame on you again Target!
593,0,"Target's online shopping has been great during this pandemic.  They (like some other companies) are technically sophisticated enough to use their App to predict how close you are to the store/curbside pickup.  Several times I've pulled into a curbside spot and the person is standing there waiting for me.  Returns are easy and at times for small items, they've just said ""keep or donate"" to avoid shipping/hassle.  No company is perfect, but Target makes things pretty easy.  Online checkout is a breeze and getting easier.  No complaints."
1902,0,Beware! Big rip off! Representative said one thing and then ripped us off $40! Can't believe what they say!!
1850,0,I received an authorization hold on my paypal account after a transaction already posted. The amount was higher then what the order purchase was. Target deducted the money from my paypal account and held my money. I have been working with Paypal and Target on the issue and Target customer service is useless saying they want to help but they cant. All they need to do is remove the hold. I do not feel like waiting 30 days to have money deducted twice from my account this makes no sense. DO NOT ORDER FROM TARGET EVER!!!!!
2184,0,I went to the Columbia MO target this afternoon. Hoping to find the perfect swimsuit for a party this weekend. When the swimsuit I wanted wasn’t in the store. Payton the sales associate in the women swim wear. Came she was super friendly and helpful. She didn’t leave my side until I found a swim suit that I loved! I will be going back to this store she was amazing! Good job Payton!!
2376,0,I enjoy shopping for a lot of things in the store. I am a plus size women and the clothes for me in your store are very few and what is there are very poor quality .Very disappointing!   My store is in Hanover Pa.
1491,0,"I ordered a couple items for pick up. They did not have them for pick up, so ty offered free shipping, which was supposed to take 4 days. Then they moved my delivery back 2 weeks, then cancelled it completely.  Very bad business. I cannot trust them for an order."
1818,0,"You know how fast things roll through your mind even within just a matter of a few seconds? When the honey pot commercial started, I thought how cool it was that Target  would give a small business; maybe something she created in her home, such a GREAT opportunity. But then, the comment she made regarding helping the next black girl......stunned. So disappointing."
749,0,I placed my first online grocery order for pickup yesterday.  I only ordered a few items.  A box of jello and a frozen pizza which they can't screw up!  The only other item that I ordered was two bananas.  Doesn't sound too difficult right?  I opened the order and much to my surprize both bananas were rotten!  Loaded with brown rotted areas inside and out!  They looked as though they had been sitting for weeks!  Just out of curiosity I made a personal trip today and had to see for my self.  Most of the bananas were good.  The worst was much much better than what I was given!  What a shame that people who are depending on their shoppers to pick decent product out for them are so blatantly lazy that they don't take a few minutes to make decent selections for their customers.  I will never use this service again!
148,0,buy 3 household products get a 5 gift card but the 3 household products are increased ion price
338,0,I ordered a Polaroid camera online and it said I would be able to pick it up today at my local store. Well that didn’t happen because the store doesn’t pull the item off the shelf that I already paid for. It seems they have sold my item that I paid 135 dollars for my daughters Christmas gift. Oh and not to mention I have to wait 5 days now to get my refund. So basically I can’t get her the camera she wanted because I won’t recieve my refund in time to re buy the camera somewhere else. This beats all I’ve ever seen. Why can’t they just ship me a camera or give me that credit toward one they do have in stock. Nope the only option was I either drive 4 hours to a store that has two items left. Or the refund. It’s crazy. Never again
2158,0,"I was out of town and ran out of minutes on my cell phone.  I decided to add minutes online instead of running out to the store.  Target's advertisement stated it offered this service.  First, the minutes did not come right away.  It takes hours.  Second, what they offer is an E-gift card with the card number and PIN number.  Tried to activate it, did not work!  I called Safelink and they could not get it to work.  I had to finally purchase minutes from Safelink.  I called Target and they told me the ""vendor"" said the card was valid. They would not issue a refund and instead sent another E-gift card for minutes I do not need and cannot regift.  Totally dissatisfied with this service and I cannot trust Target to purchase online again."
2087,0,"I bought a $30 gift card from target. It was hacked, all money was gone when my friend tried to use card. I called customer service. They told me if they don't suspect anything fraud they will not replace card and buying gift cards is at our own risk. Warning to everyone!!! Do not buy their gift cards!!!"
2021,0,"After having several problems with my Target credit card bills, I had stopped shopping at Target. It was just easiet to order items elsewhere. However, when I saw they had free 2 hour delivery, I got sucked back in. Well, 4 items were missing from my order. When I called to find out why the order showed :""cancelled by guest,"" when I had not cancelled anything, I was put on hold for about 20 minutes before someone got on just to say,"" yes, this happens often. ""  No resolution or anything. Bad delivery service and bad cusomer service. Walmart is so much better for delivery!"
2368,0,I should've read these before ordering I suppose. Placed an order for pickup in store December 11. Received an email product no longer available in store must pick another route so I picked 2 day shipping. Should've been delivered December 13 received email would be December 17 then email for December 19 then email for December 28. Have been in contact with customer service 3 times and all said it'll be here before Christmas. That didn't happen. It was processed on December 11 so I couldn't cancel and then it supposedly shipped on December 19 but it is now December 27 and I haven't received my 2 day shipping item how is that????? Target ruins Christmas!!! I will tell EVERYONE!!!
2116,0,"I had one of the worst experiences of my life at target grand central.  One of their employees was very disrespectful.  She scolded me when I was standing in the queue to pay for the shopping and blamed me that  my son, who is only 4 years, was steeling candies from the store.  This has given me a shock.  I don’t believe that employee.  My son was standing there with me in the queue and he had no candies with him.  Even if my son has done something wrong, she could have told me that privately, instead of insulting me in front of the entire crowd.  I am a Muslim and I wear a scarf my be that is the reason why she treated me like that."
578,0,"To: Target Corporate Headquarters.  I was in the process of making an online Target order today, but stopped momentarily to check my mailbox for incoming mail. I was a little surprised when I saw one piece of the mail I received was from Target. It was some kind of ""warning letter"" stating their policy is to ""close"" accounts that have been inactive for an ""extended period of time"". Extended period of time??  What?? Really?? It is now 02/2022. I last used my Target credit card the end of 07/2021, less then 8 months ago. I appreciated the ""warning"" but still somewhat confused about the ""inactivety"" definition. because my last active use. I'm also finding their seems to be a ""conflict"" with my current Target credit stating it is good for my use thru ""05/2023"".  I realize some credit card companies do issue these type of ""warning letters"", but I've never received one. I have excellent credit scores. I pay all bills fully and on time and feel I am a good customer. It is disappointing that Target appears to place such little consumer value on good, loyal customers. Before reading the ""warning letter"" I was already in the process of placing a online Target order.  The ""letter"" made me hesitant in completing the order, but I did eventually complete my order inspite of my discomfort."
552,0,"DO NOT BUY YOUR GLASSES at a Target store. I bought a pair at the Hampton Village store. Had to go back repeatedly, every two weeks to try to get the glasses to fit. After at least 5 trips back to the store, I asked to return the glasses. They said NO--the return period had expired. The return period expired BECAUSE I was trying to get them to make the glasses fit! Never again!!"
367,0,"Target is always pleasant experience. If have a problem, they are quick to resolve it."
2067,0,"Target on Stirling Road and University Dr. in Davie, Florida has become the worst Target I have shopped at. I prefer Target over Walmart as in my opinion Target has always been cleaner, the associates more courteous and helpful, less patrons and a faster checkout. Unfortunately after today’s horrible experience that has left me embarrassed, upset and utterly mortified by a specific employee (whom I asked for assistance with pricing), a Manager and 4 other associates I can no longer in good conscience recommend this specific Target. I immediately took their survey upon getting in my car. Four other patrons that witnessed the scenario approached me on the way to my car and said how that could not believe what they had just witnesses take place. I cannot say I will not shop Target again as I will, I will just be going to a different one even though it’s further from my residence."
1972,0,"I bought a small shoe rack for $10 at Target. When I came home to put it together, I noticed the construction was a cheap plastic, one ""elbow"" part was cracked, and it was complicated to put it together. I decided to look for another shoe rack for the same price at Wal-Mart. Well, I was surprised! For the same price I got a metal construction, much easier to put together. What a difference! I returned it with no problem, of course. Target, as Wal-Mart is good at that. The issue is: compare the prices and quality. For the same price, Wal-Mart may be the winner."
653,0,Terrible customer service I would 100% not recommend recommend shopping on their website. Their customer support is so shockingly bad. They take forever and are not clear and understandable on their online chart. Stay far far away

2558,0,Terrible customer service has happened over and over an item shows available near me. I place the order and head out to pick it up and it’s not available. It makes you waste time and money! They have review after review of terrible customer service!! Better off ordering off Amazon

2415,2,"Poor customer service alert*** I ordered something from Target.com on Nov 26 (cyber Monday).  I chose to have it shipped to the store for pick up. It said it would be ready between Dec 1-Dec 5. On Dec 5, I got an email saying it had been delayed, and was now expected between Dec 5-Dec 9. No word by Dec 9, so I stopped in the store to ask. They looked at the email, and said it had been shipped to the store, but they were running behind, check back in a few days. Ok that's understandable.  Its the holidays, I get it.  Today, Dec 10, I get an email saying they had to cancel the order.  Sorry. But don't worry we didn't charge you.   TARGET, this is not okay!!!!! You jerk me around for 2 weeks then cancel my order??? Seriously? This is why Amazon is winning. Realistically, I can't say I'll never shop at Target again, but I certainly won't be shopping there for the rest of this season. Next year, I'll stick to Amazon. #targetisagrinch #firstitemonherchristmaslist #amazonwillfixthis"
1584,0,"Don't worry target, these old white people will disappear, and their calls of ""reverse racism"" is them being racist towards a woman of color wanting others to succeed. It is a great commercial"
301,0,"I stopped buying things from Target altogether after unethical behavior by multiple employees, including a truck driver who lives near me and has been driving a ""Target"" truck around on a daily basis, probably not even making deliveries most of the time. He is driving in a deliberately intimidating manner on the interstate around the Wilton, NY region, honking, cutting off, etc. The truck has Maine license plates. Clearly, Target either does not care about ethics or does not have much control over the behavior of employees. I will also cancel my Target delivery service through which in the past I've ordered over $1000 worth of items. Target rewards loyal customers by allowing employees to participate in harassment of their own neighbors. Shame on them."
1017,0,"I had a great experience with the DriveUp at the Target in Fultondale, Alabama.  Easy to order online, use the phone app to see when my order was ready, notify the store I was on my way, and was met by an employee as soon as I drove up.  Only one item not in stock but I was offered the option to have it delivered to my home at no extra cost.  Great service!"
1328,0,"If you buy items that give you a gift card, make sure you use it for another transaction  right after to make sure it works. Do not wait til you come back another day. I was screwed of of 5 bucks. I guess if you hold on to your receipt with it they could fix it. I will make a 2nd translation from now on."
1429,0,I’ve never had an issue with ordering from Target. One of my favorite stores to shop from both online & in store.
1618,0,I love shopping at Target and that they support new businesses of women of color is a plus. Black History month is a great time to expose people about new products  I also love that the the honey pot panty liners are herbal without harsh chemicals.
492,0,These silicone back scrubs aren’t worth it even if they were free they are useless. I purchased four pack from Target for $16.99 and the only use I found for them was that my puppy teething liked it. He like tug a war so these are prefect for that not for scrubbing your back.
2128,0,"All I can say is thank goodness for Walmart!!!  I ordered a stroller for a baby shower being held on September 28th. The stroller was ordered September 2nd. I received an email indicating there was a new arrival date ofSeptember 14th. Ok, no probkem I thought, I have time. Close-to September 14th I received another email indicating the new delivery date would be September 18th. September 18th I received an email indicating they canceled my order due to technical issues on their side. When I called support she indicated there was a problem getting it delivered to the store. My question is instead of sending an email why did no one make a phone call to me notifiying me my order had been cancelled. A customer service rep indicated she could have it to me by September 24th I asked if they could send it Priority, that was a negative. I told her I will order it from someone that I know will have it delivered when indicated. I placed my order at 3 in the afternoon on Walmart.com indicated it would be at my home the next day, by the way there was no charge for shipping. Stroller was delivered to my home the next day."
1256,0,I loved Target for years.  I never saw this day coming but I will no longer buy clothes.  Im sad they remodeled stores and they have cheapen the clothes and charge more for them.  It looks like Goodwill in there.  Bring back the old Target clothes..pleeeeaseThis vendor is not working
849,0,"I would give Target negative stars if I could. After many years of holding a red card, they arbitrarily closed it after not using it for a year. This hurts your credit score by lowering your total available credit and lowering the  years of extended credit you have. Transunion suggests calling and asking it to be reinstated, but Target says  the only option is to reapply. I asked if it cost them money to keep an account open that hasn't been used in awhile. No answer. Why would they actively seek to lose customers? Very disappointed and after speaking to customer service, just disgusted."
435,0,"I made an online purchase to drive up and pick up. I attempted to pick up my order twice. Both times there weren’t any parking spots because all of the Drive up Spaces were full. I waited for over an hour, which is ridiculous. I ended up leaving because I was so frustrated at how long it was taking for me to get TWO items. I have never been this unsatisfied with a company. I will travel further to go to another store because this one is a joke!"
1797,2,"Wow Target, way to approve a blatantly racist commercial for honey pot. I'm so disgusted and disappointed in your company. As a woman who is so far from being racist yet belonging to a race who is constantly accused of racism this infuriates me. Why can't we as women want to empower other women or even just other people period no matter what race we are? By you allowing racist people to sell their products in your store you are promoting said racism. I will no longer shop Target, Walmart is better anyway, and will make sure to spread the word about how your store promotes racism and divide!!"
1968,0,"Horrible customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!! South Shore Plaza aka Braintree Mall Target is one of the worst I have ever been to. I went to pick up an online huggies pamper order that was placed a day prior and it still wasnt ready. The customer service person who helped me kept replying ""Sorry not sure what happened theres nothing I can do, do you just want to cancel the order"" instead of finding out where the pampers were. When I asked for a manager she informed me they were all busy. I def will not be visiting that store again."
406,0,I ordered online for drive up pickup and after almost 4 hours from the time I ordered my order was still being “processed.” I called the local store 4 Times to let them know I was sitting outside in the car in 90 degree weather with my infant who’s SICK. Only ONE representative had the nerve to APOLOGIZE for my bad experience. Everyone else said there was nothing they can do. I sat there hearing that each time I called with my sick son in the backseat crying. The last time I called I asked for corporates number and when I called corporate someone picked up the phone with CHEERING and people CELEBRATING in the background. I did NOT feel heard. I even had to ask if I was on the phone with the corporate office. I cancelled my order before I left because all I needed was MEDICINE for my sick child. I’ll never use this service again and it’ll be a while before I trust Target to offer good service again. The way I was spoken to by each any every person that was a part of my Target experience today tells me that Target will surely be out of business within the coming decade.

Today, December the 7th I got an email saying my order has been canceled because they are out of stock. Why did they even pretend to fill my order if they didn't have the merchandise????? However, They still have my money and they said it would take 10 days for my refund. So now my money is being held hostage for merchandise they never had and I don't have anyway to reorder from someone else. This is the worse service I've ever had from a retailer."

I order an item online, it says it was delivered -- to a city an hour away from me -- and the online system says I'm refunded, for $1.99 LESS than what I paid because it charged me for shipping, which I got free shipping because I'm a card holder.  Then the ""chat"" system comes up with a guy to help, but it's literally impossible to type into the screen.  There's no other way to contact them except call during the workday when I'm, uhh, working!! and not taking a break to call about an $11 Target just ripped me off on.  Target has sunk to the level of the big W, just as bad."
2179,0,I felt verbally assaulted by management and uncomfortable when asking questions to them. The woman used harsh language when explaining I could ask questions to better my experience. She then was snippy and raised her volume and tone of voice when I asked for help. I will not be returning.
1187,0,"I ordered an item online in September, it was a preorder. With a pre order your credit card is authorized and held until the item is shipped. Well Target authorized my card twice, tying up over 500 dollars. When I called and spoke to several different people they kept telling me that is the way they process. So they are saying you get authorized twice. Then I was told it had to do with my bank. Which I knew it didnt but to confirm I called the bank and as I had already knew the authorization  comes from the vendr ,Target. I then called Target.com guest relations again and got the same run around and was told to call the bank. When I asked for a Supervisor I was told there is nothing they can do.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM TARGET AGAIN!  How disappointing! Not only did they authorize my cc twice for over $500.. not one representTive could reverse or even send me to someone that could fix the error that was on Targets side.  Mistakes are made and it happens but you fix those mistakes in order to have repeat business. Unfortunately this is not the case with this company.  Terrible customer relations!!"
899,0,"Placed an online order and it was sent to the wrong address.. and here the nightmare begins:1. Target is not able to update the address on the order, even when it hasn't even shipped yet.2. They tell me to call when it ships, so they can update it.. which I did.. and they tell me they can't UNTIL the carrier actually has updates. By the time that is available, the carrier already delivered it (that was the original order)3. While on the phone, Target just replaces the order with an IDENTICAL order, with -again- the wrong address...4. On that same call, they are UNABLE to update the shipping address.. even though it hasn't shipped yet!5. I call a day later to have them redirect. They are unable, because -they say- UPS will transfer the order to USPS.. (still.. they should be able to)6. I check a day after that.. and guess what.. ""out for delivery"".. through UPS. (not a mention of USPS).Target is so incredibly unprofessional and inept, it's a huge miracle they are even still in business!"
2356,0,"First time using  new Target Redcard. Representative did my order for me over the phone. He used a promo code for $10 off along with a $5 price match and $5 off for using Redcard. Bill does not reflect all discounts. Redcard discount went through but either they did not price match like they promised for $5 or the did not give me the total $10 promo discount also promised and only gave me $5 instead. Very hard people to deal with. If I was promised the discount I should have received it. Called and was told that Amazon no longer can be priced matched as their price went up, although it was price matched at $5 less at the time of my order and another rep. told me that the person doing my order was wrong on the discount and it only qualified for $5 instead of $10. Two different stories. And my bill is the $5 + .41 cents tax more than it should be.  If you order through them and they give you a discount, they should have it documented correctly and stick to it so there is no confusion. Very disappointed. Especially with two different reps giving me two different reasons why my charge on my card is $5.41 more than it should be. Now I know why I closed out this card a few years ago!!! They were also rude on my insisting to correct their mistake, which they did not fix.  Was on the phone for over 1 1/2 hours from person to person and still Target.com refused to fix their own mistake.  Shame on you for being so unfair Target.com Susan Houppert"
1029,0,"It's a 3 star, because of several reasons. One is shipping costs, now you have to pay more than $35 to get free shipping, it used to be lower, but now they force you to buy more stuff for free shipping. Some Target stores are great, some not. Some target stores, the aisles are empty, especially the smaller stores that they don't have a lot, bigger stores employees and more strict. Sometimes cashiers did something wrong which causes trouble. Target is one of my main stores I go to, but not all kinds of stuff they sell. The shoes they sell at Target is classic, there's no shoes like Nike or Adidas. Some clothes are names that I never heard of. Some Target stores don't have restrooms, and they sometimes stink with no fan to get the stinky smell away. Target is average, Target may be good or bad, depend on the Store size, location, and stock avalibility."

165,2,"The only reason I even gave them two stars, as opposed to one star, is because they're quick to resolve potential returns, but as it pertains to other situations they're awful. Chat is a joke. Today I dealt with ""Emma"" and I asked why stores seem to be selling the new NECA April O'Neil figure and the site has no mention at all. Usually, even if an item is out of stock it will show you the item, but will state the item as ""no longer in stock"". There is absolutely no mention at all. I tried explaining this and they just don't comprehend anything. She asks me right after what the UPC is. If I had it I wouldn't be asking her about it. Then, she says she will see about it and promptly ends the chat.I try again with a different person. Same result. I lead off with telling her about the chat ending and I get excuses, followed by her not understanding that the item is not on the site yet, but in stores. And the store in Lafayette, LA on Ambassador isn't answering phones  in any department. She tells me they are probably busy. All of them? All I get are excuses. Just tell me they haven't listed them yet. Something. She then says the store inventory and the site are two different entities. No kidding. I call the third time (this time by phone). Again, he asks me the item number. If I had the number to order the item I would just sit on it (the site page) until it's restocked. Do these people understand basic grammar? I've caught them in lies. These are the people representing your company. And at the crux of all of this, how are items in stores being released early and not have online availability? Not all of us live near your stores, and if people aren't answering the phones then I can't see if it's available, because I'm not driving that far just to see something that should be online or at the very least give me an idea if I can place a pickup order. Nevermind the ceedy politics target practices. How about focus on your actual customers, and stop pretending you're political activists. It's a conflict of interests. Pick a side. Be in politics or be in business."

2372,0,I was in the Springdale target 2 days before Christmas.  I was in the return line I had to return my granddaughters pajamas.  There was about 7 or 8 people ahead of me.  This black female employee came over and told us that we all had to get out of the line and go stand at the end of the other line which was even longer.I told her that she was trying to incite a riot. She went and got Hecia who also told me that I had to get at the end of the other line. He also instructed 2 different cashiers not to wait on me.  The people ahead of me went on to cash out while I was talking to the mangers which they had the right to because they had been waiting also. But I went to the security person and explain to him and he said no it's not fair but I need to leave before the police arrive and go file a compliant. The police were on their way. It is now Christmas day and I still have not exchanged my granddaughter pajamas as of yet.

The manager seemed disinterested in my complaint and gave a off handed apology. Called corporate to register a complaint. They offered me a $10. Gift card. Was contacted by their insurance company the next day.she hung up on me when I told her how upset I was and that I will NEVER step foot in a target store again. Good luck in the future Target.

She then asked what I needed the kit for, and I noted the problem.  She asked ""do you have your glasses with you""?  Yes, I do, but I did not purchase them here.

The next day I walked in to exchange my pants for a different size and she was so snotty about it! Unbelievable Target, I do not recommend this store, I'm a ten year old and deserve to be treated kindly.  My mom's friend was with me and he couldn't believe how rude the employees were to me."

1742,2,Haters in the comment section should be banned .... IF YOU HAVE NOT USED THE PRODUCT then their comments should be flagged and deleted.  No one cares how you feel it was in honor of black history month.   People really show their true racism if they act like black people have come a long way.  This is great seeing young women of color advancing their products in major stores.  Knock it off and get out of your feelings. To my original point if you have to used the product STFU!

385,0,"The fact that Target won’t let you exchange a Target gift card for one that has a different design is super annoying. Also, just wanted to have an explanation as to why they wouldn’t let me use my Target gift card balance to get three smaller gift cards but they send me on some weird route. The chat person made me call, I explained my issue to the person on the phone. First, she tells me that she can use a balance so that I get the three gift cards then places me on hold for half an hour just to tell me I can’t use my balance to get the gift cards. She no the future, I’m just using Amazon. Target is a serious pain"
1947,0,I return 4 package to usps nov 12 and two package made it on November 22nd  at the warehouse. 2 other package was tried to delivered  on the november 29 but there an error or something so they received it on November 30.So you assume they will issue me my refund but get what no refund.So 19 days outs no refund issued. So I called target and the supervisor issue the refund into 2 different gift cardsSo if I wouldn’t call them They would a kept the money. No wonder rich gets richer
1437,0,"They scammed me. I have a gift card and try to shop online, but every product I try to purchase is ""unable to ship to my ZIP code"". So basically, I gave them money by purchasing the gift card, but cannot use it, so, therefore, they cannot give up their products. Complete scam."
2373,0,"I should have read the reviews before ordering a Christmas gift from target.com.  I dido all of the other reviews.  Target.com sucks.

They promised delivery December 19 then 21 then 24, now they don’t even know where it’s at.  I will never shop at Target.com."
1226,0,I like this store very much my concern is in the middle of a pandemic non-service animals are still allow in the store was in there 9/27/2020 saw one while I was shopping and a big one coming in when I was leaving. Seriously thinking about finding another store that don't allow non-service animals
2049,0,Target had an offer for purchasing an iPhone and offered a gift card with purchase. It was for one day only. Made the purchase late in  evening and was waiting on email that the phone was ready. It didn't come in until 10pm. Only had to complete the activation and no where did it state gift card contingent on activation. Went in the next morning to complete the activation and was denied the gift card. Called corporate and was told it was up to the store. Please beware when making purchases with gift card promotions. They are not honored.
1489,0,Thanks Target for being awesome through this covid 19 virus. You are the closest store to us to get everyday needs plus groceries. Always found the cashiers in the Springdale Oh store to be great
1417,0,I love Target!  They were open when WALMART wasn’t. Their shipping wasn’t too badly effected by the virus and everyone working in the store was helpful.  Other stores were inconvenienced by us shopping for necessities
1998,0,Nov 26 I placed an online order through target.com the website first erred by putting the wrong size when I placed the order which I found out after going to pick up the item. At that time the clerk made a return of the item and said it would take 24 hrs to find my refund returned to my account. On Nov 27 I did not receive my refund so I contacted target.com and advised that I expected a full refund of this purchase. They then said the return would take 4-7 days to receive and instead of refunding my money they would send me a gift card in that amount via email. I don’t want a gift card I will never shop there again if this is how they do business. I have yet to receive my refund and currently it is Dec 6.
83,0,"So much use of plastic, no option to buy reusable bags and bags aren’t durable at all so easily broken meaning heavy groceries will not last long before your bag rips. In 2023 with the climate change awareness we have surely a big business like Target would try and make their ways more eco friendly to help save our environment, however this is not the case with many different types of plastic being used to an extreme amount."
513,0,Garbage company! I ordered a 65” tv online and they said it was delivered when it obviously wasn’t.They didn’t provide me with any proof of where it was delivered nor a proof of signature which they claim they got.I have reported them and disputed the credit card charges.  Customer service is crap. All outsourced and no idea what’s going. Talk to a supervisor and you’ll be more disappointed from the stupidity you have to deal with.Buy at your own risk
817,0,"I am sorry, but I have to vent.  I have decided to no longer shop at Target.  They have proven to me that they do not value their customers at all.  While preparing to come to Florida to be with my Mother, I prescheduled my payment (always early and a lot more than the minimum) to be paid on 5/31/2021 (not due until 6/10/21).  I did not realize that it was set to come out of John's personal checking account, which was closed and now ""Estate Account"".  Well the old checking account returned the payment and notified me.  When I pulled up the account, I was charged $50 for returned check AND $29 for late payment, reminder not due until 6/10/21.  I called and explained the error and the situation I was in at the time I scheduled it.  I was told they could not remove the fees, asked for Supervisor and was told ""they're going to tell you the same thing"".  So I wrote a message and repeated the situation.  I got a response that the fees can not be removed because it was my fault.  I wrote back advising I will pay off my balance and then close my account.  Not valued at all."

1528,0,"I used PayPal for payment of an online Target order. I cancelled my online order shortly after I placed the order. I cancelled the order before I ever received the email that the item was ready for pick-up. I never went to the store to pick it up. I never had possession of the item.  Shortly later, I received an email that the order was cancelled and the amount of money charged to my PayPal account (which is linked to my bank account) was now listed at $0.00. Knowingly sending false information is fraud. Target has taken my $164.29 and will not give me my money back. Customer service said they had to have the situation investigated by their ""online order team"" to move forward. I pleaded with the customer service agent, saying the virus lockdown has crushed my income and I REALLY needed her help. I got no help and very politely asked for her supervisor. After waiting for about 20 minutes they disconnected the call. Never being notified that using Paypal would eliminate my right to the publicly listed return policy doesn't seem legal.  I am now on a very long hold again to plead for their help during this national emergency. I will choose a good alternative to PayPal (my brief research informed me of PayPal's new policy of keeping $ despite legitimate consumer returns drives this fraudulent behavior) & as for Target, they can't be trusted. They execute this money grab in direct contradiction to their printed return policy with no clear communication to consumer about the ramifications of using PayPal for ecommerce payment"

I was logged into my account and had two items in my cart. When I went to checkout I was told to log in, which made no sense, then told my account doesn't exist. First agent simply told me I don't have an account AS I WAS LOGGED IN!  Unbelievable.Second agent found my cart, took my credit card information then dead silence. He wasn't heard from again. I waited. Nothing.Third agent wasn't sure of herself. Finally, the order was placed, both for pickup at two different stores. An hour later I received two separate emails stating neither item is available. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. YES, I'M ANGRY.  Fix it.I'll be writing to corporate as well."
1877,0,"Within the last month I’ve ordered from Target.com during the after Thanksgiving and after Christmas sales. In my first order, after Thanksgiving, I placed and order. Was given a date for delivery and the date came and went without any notification of where my order was. I waited about 3 days just in case there was some issue and still nothing. Finally contact customer service and they reorder and a week after that I get an order. 2nd time I order was after Christmas. I hesitated after my 1st experience but decided to try it again in case the last time was just a fluke. Well, you guessed it, the delivery date came and went and nothing. This time I wait a week because I was incredibly busy and didn’t have time. I contact customer and just cancel. My complaint isn’t with customer service or Target store but with their shipping service. I think about companies like Amazon where I am able to order almost anything I can think of and get it in 2 days but a huge company like Target can’t get it together to keep to their promised delivery dates. This is what has led me to write this review. I would suggest having it delivered to the store and picking it up. Apparently it’s too much trouble for the companies they choose for delivering."

1407,0,"Ordering from Target for store pickup:  very easy.  Picking up at store in Capitola CA: A NIGHTMARE!  I realize we are all getting used to the issues that this pandemic has brought to all of us, but there is no excuse for rudeness or lack of customer service.  Here is what happened when 2 seniors (one with Parkinson's)  visited on Saturday 5/30 between 2 and 2:45.  We had been upstairs to look for something and I noticed the ""Pick up here"" sign, but there was no one there and all dark, so I assumed it was down stairs to service many more customers than normal.  We went to the register downstairs after putting milk, creamer and dishwasher detergent in cart.  I asked the young lady who was there to enforce the 6 feet apart rule and let customers one by on to the register, where the pick up counter was.  She said up stairs.  I said could someone please go up and pick it up for us as we were already upstairs and no one was there at the time.  She said, that is the only pickup.  You have to go upstairs.  I voiced my unhappiness and asked to speak to a manager.  I thought she ignored me as she went to let the next person to the register.  However, a young man appeared and said I will try to get the manager.  We waited and finally went to the escalator our selves.  Meanwhile, our cart got stuck as there was a big package of toilet paper (not from our cart) that had stopped the machine.  They said to go up and they will meet us there.  We waited and it was not an easy fix, so I went to the pick up counter and left my husband there to wait for our cart.  The young man at the pickup counter asked for my bar code, while I was getting my phone out, he walked away.  Then when I had the phone, he came back, I showed him the bar code, he got the package, then gave it to me, all without any words(?)  Is that typical, maybe?  Meanwhile, another employee carried our 3 items with my husband following and put them in another cart that was near the pickup counter.  I asked if it had been wiped down, she did not answer, then I asked again and she said ""yes, do you want me to wipe it down again?""  A simple yes answer was all that was needed.  Back downstairs, the young man recognized us and pointed to the manager.  She asked if she could help, and I said no, we got it ourselves and won't be back.  She said Hope you have a nice day.  I cannot think of another reason to EVER go visit this target (the only one in our area)"

289,0,My store in Eugene Oregon never has any shopping carts available. The store manager said they have 12. He would not say what we all know that the homeless bums steal them. That is not Target's fault I get that. The funny thing is that directly across the street Walmart has hundreds of carts. Granted they aren't plastic so that may be a hint.I will not be  shopping at this Target  until they get some carts for the customers.  Why because it's impossible to shop for multiple items with a stupid cart.

1425,0,"I have ordered from Brandywine (Wilmington, DE) Target curbside pickup for over a year now and have had issues with over half of my orders (which I place frequently.)If this began at the time of COVID-19, I would 100% understand. However, this is not the case. In over half of my orders, I was missing items. At this point, I’m unable to get out of the car to check my order (which isn’t my responsibility anyway) due to crowded parking lots and people not wearing masks.  I have severe asthma and am considered high risk for infection. I shouldn’t have to put my life on the line to get what I paid for.Recently, I ordered a storage bin which came out without a lid. The employee said she would be back with it. After waiting 30 minutes, I had to talk to another employee and found out that the first person I dealt with left for the day and didn’t relay the information. While the second employee did attempt to help, she had to go into the store twice (20+ minute wait for both times) and came back saying they didn’t have it. I was told I had to go in to the store to get refunded and I’m unable to do so due to health risks. The very next order I placed was missing FOUR items. Everything was jammed into a large target bag (too heavy to carry anyway) and I had to claw it open. I only noticed one item missing because I didn’t have time to go through item by item. When I called the store, I was not able to reach guest services and was eventually told by someone in electronics (only department that I could reach someone) that I would have to come in for the item because I wouldn’t be able to reach guest services at all. First of all, this is not an isolated incident and it is not acceptable when I have a 30 minute drive (one way) and there’s a solid chance that the item will be sold out and I’ll have to wait in an extremely long line just to find that out. Besides the fact that I put my own and my family’s lives in danger while we are trying to quarantine to save our own and others health and safety. Although target will EVENTUALLY refund you, that doesn’t excuse the fact that this is happening. I ordered those items because INEED them. The refund isn’t processed for several days. Now is not the time to be waiting for money with myself laid off and my husband’s hours cut.  Now, I have to wait 3-5 business days to buy my dog food because of this. Sadly, we don’t have any money to be able to do that at the moment. After hours of waiting on hold for the store and the corporate office (on multiple occasions), I was told that their only solution is to provide feedback to the store.Anybody that knows about business knows that this is not a solution that will work anytime soon. It also does nothing to help my personal situation. Target refuses to do anything to rectify and most at the corporate office were rude and unapologetic. Not to mention that I was disconnected and/or hung up on multiple times, furthering my time taken to remedy this. This is absolutely appalling and unacceptable but they won’t do a thing about it. They truly feel that it is reasonable for me to risk my life  to fix a problem on their end. Meanwhile, this company makes billions of dollars. It’s sad that this is the way that Target conducts business in general but particularly during this time."

First, the minutes did not come right away.  It takes hours.  Second, what they offer is an E-gift card with the card number and PIN number.  Tried to activate it, did not work!  I called Safelink and they could not get it to work.  I had to finally purchase minutes from Safelink.  I called Target and they told me the ""vendor"" said the card was valid. They would not issue a refund and instead sent another E-gift card for minutes I do not need and cannot regift.  Totally dissatisfied with this service and I cannot trust Target to purchase online again."
1053,2,I ordered a verizon wireless Refill card online they told me they were going to send me the pin number in 4 hours and they never did it then 10 hours later i contacted them by live chat the woman who treated me told me that they sent the pin # by E:mail but that was not true and then i called customer service to refund my money and they said Not all that inconvenience caused me that verizon deactivated my phone service i do not recommend anyone to buy anything online in Target They are very irresponsable first time i ordered online with them and my experience was very bad 1 star rating for Target is too much
596,0,"Target has banned me from buying things online on my first purchase. The policies are also absolutely stupid. I have not been given a good reason for my purchase cancelations either, so I am very irritated, because I want to buy online only items with $130 of gift cards. I am not going to purchase anything from target again unless they can make up for this. I know I am one customer in millions, but I am still quite irritated at this."
1875,0,"Placed three rugs in their online shopping cart as all three were available online for shipping and I didn’t have to drive around to different locations in the hopes of finding them. I went to check out and I couldn’t find the Guest Checkout. Asked their “Chat” and was told by “Gary” that I have to register for a member account to shop online. I told “Gary” that this policy was outdated and not customer friendly. I finished with “you just lost a sale”; interesting that “Gary” closed the chat without any thank you or apology. So, you can walk into their stores and shop without a member account but you are required to have one to purchase online. Target is in its death knell."

1971,0,"As I type this, I'm currently on hold for 2 hours, 15 minutes, 12 seconds and counting...I tried online Chat, but they rejected talking to me because my issue was with an in-store purchase. Target sold an item with a $35 gift card. I returned the unopened item the next week and gave back the gift card. They refused it and said I had to keep the gift card and they would only refund the price minus $35. Essentially, they made me buy a non-refundable gift card. I don't think this is even legal in California. That said, I'm going to stick with Amazon moving forward with purchases. None of this shady business."
2359,0,"I bought my adult son a Target gift card to be texted to his phone on Dec. 19th.  He never received it so while I was waiting for customer service to answer I purchase another gift card on Dec23rd which was immediately canceled. So I purchased another gift card which was also canceled immediately. I had over $1,000 in the bank & no problems with my account. While customer service had me on hold I was disconnected. So I called back. Waited on hold for 40 minutes & was disconnected. I called the day AFTER Christmas to find out why they kept my $100 & sent no card. They said they sent it. I called back to speak with a Supervisor & she said she was activating a card that I found in my SPAM & giving me a $100 gift card as a customer service gesture. My son took the card today, Dec 31st, 2018 to Target & it had been canceled. So I have no refund as of today & no gift card for my son after spending over 4 hours on the phone with Target. Everyone before Christmas was from the Philippines & they said they don't have supervisors. Target doesn't keep their promises & I am still waiting for a refund. Christmas ruined for my son. Never will I ever walk into a Target store or give them a penny of my money ever again.  Target's reviews are 62% bad.

You must find him online and read how much he says Satan loves us. How many of your customers fall into the trans and satanist category? I don’t know but I hope you lose all the other groups of customers. Hell will freeze before I walk back through your doors. There are plenty of other places I can shop with my family.

If I hadn't double checked my order, it would have gone to a different city. It literally took me one hour and 3 minutes to complete the order. I expect more even from Walmart for crying out loud.

It seems I was changing her all the time and she was always soaking through them and her clothes especially at night. We are using them, can't afford not to but had to purchase another brand for at night. I'm sorry I truly like many of your other products, just not your diapers. Thanks for listening"
2140,0,What the heck has happened to Target?!  I love the store and have shopped there for years.  In the last year the local stores have become a mess.  Shelves are disorganized with open empty areas everywhere. Things left in the wrong aisle everywhere.  Most recently(today) bananas on the floor. Boxes of new items sitting in aisles for multiple days so you can't get to the existing items on shelves. The floors are dirty.  The bathrooms stink! I'm sad to see this happen as Target used to be a well-oiled machine.  Obvious cutbacks on staff for stocking and cleaning are making my friends and me want to go elsewhere.  It was so bad today I took a couple of pictures.  So sad.
1922,0,"I bought a gift ($15.00) from Target. I found another toy the same but a lower price. I return it with the receipt and I paid with a debit card the cashier should give me cash or the money should be going back into my card if I chose to, but I chose to get cash and the cashier so no either going back into the card or store credit. So I rather let it's going back into my card instead of store credit. This is the Target on Auburn Hills at Brown road. I will never go back to that store again."

1419,0,"Would love to leave zero stars if I could. Since the pandemic started in March we have been using the Target on bald hill road in Warwick RI for drive up so we don’t have to take our infant into the store! Have spent well over $850 and I have the receipts to prove it ... never once have we had an issue with pick up. Most of the drive up personnel are very friendly and happy to still have a job ! For the past two times I had used the pick up service I had to deal with an associate that clearly hates what she is doing and is extremely rude and condescending. The first time , I brushed her awful attitude off as she was having a bad day. But this most recent trip, I am not brushing it off and Target just lost a customer!!!! I waited over 3 hours for the order to be picked no biggie. I was already on bald hill road I needed to pick up an order across the road. When my target order said done, excellent I pulled into the parking lot into the spot and put I’m here. When I saw the same woman walk out I said oh boy , popped my trunk and had my phone ready. I said “ hello” she proceeded to tell me “ next time you come here you need to use the app properly“ “ we are monitoring for people like you that don’t use it properly” I said “ you must be mistaken , the app said my order was ready for pick up - so I’m here to pick up?” She then began to talk to me like I was her child and tell me I was using it wrong and that I need to give them more time ? Well if I’m correct , the order said it was ready for pick up , and I’m here at pick up? I have been doing this for months and spent an awful lot of money with target ! The way she spoke to me , made me feel like Target doesn’t care who is spending money , it’s quantity over quality. So you know what ? All set ! You just lost a customer that was getting everything we needed through your drive up! I’ll go brace the lines at Walmart and take my chances with the six feet issue. Being treated with dis respect from an associate when you have no idea what I’m going through ( I work in homecare during the pandemic by the way ) and I manage to go to work with a smile ! I hope target monitors these sites and in the future teach your employees to be a little more kind. It would have hurt less if she swore at me then the condescending tone that she used !"
721,0,"TL;DR never ever says WHAT you purchased on any receipt (in-store/online, your own payment or Target REDcard, etc., just says ""Household $4.99"" or etc. for ANY item); and trying to return an item for a refund is an utter nightmare which often does not result in a refund of what you actually paid. Charges are listed ONLY as a price and an ""area"" (""household"", ""grocery"" etc.). Online purchases do not show all the items in an order; you have to click on each set as they shipped or created a pickup order of it. Then there are separate places to try to find the item description, the price, and the bar code to return it, which are not interlinked and not available in any once place. It's impossible. Is it legal to sell something for which there is no usable receipt, just a vague generalization and a price?? This insane breaking of the system has forced us to stop using Target.I used to love Target. We had a ""superstore"" that offered fresh groceries and excellent household goods (Our local Target is beautifully managed and run, but has no tools to help with what Corporate has started doing). Even before the pandemic, they stopped stocking food; you literally never knew if you could get something simple like oranges or skim milk when you went in. They did their best during the pandemic. However, some time within the last several months some greedy bean counter decided to overhaul the entire system so that neither customers nor employees had access to any sales/receipts information. It is insane. Maybe this is the corporate version of ""The Producers"" movie?"

44,0,"On July 31, 2023, at 5:45 p.m., at the Target location at 600 Greece Ridge Center Dr., Rochester, NY 14626.I personally encountered a gross lack of neglected responsibilities and unscrupulous behavior. Target's security guard, a Hispanic male between the ages of 30 and 34, accused me of stealing,stating I was going to walk my cart out the door,without paying. The approach quickly escalated to deplorable.I told him, You are incorrect, but he was adamant.The aggression was so severe that I feared for my safety.I found a female employee and asked if she could locate a store manager, reasoning, the target security is harassing me.She left to go do so,He then stated, I don't give a f----k who you call my ni*ga.I asked him to identify himself, but he would not, and there was no badge name on the uniform.I asked him to call the police, and he said they're going to put you out of the store, just like me, Whatever I tell them, you could call, but they're going to be on my side.He used every intimidation tactic to keep me from seeking help.He was criticizing my scarf and asking me why I had my face covered while shopping in the store?I tried explaining the situation to Peter B., a front-end manager; however, he would not identify the security,or assist in de-escalating the situation, he allowed the security guard to continue to invade my space,as I was speaking to him.The security guard continued to spew lies to employees to justify such unscrupulous and unethical behavior.Shopping at Target, for the most part, is a pleasure,However, When racial discrimination occurs and persists to such a degree, it is unethical and against the law. No, 54-year-old woman should encounter harassment within an establishment deemed safe.Viewers, please keep in mind that, with the exception of two sodas, hand towels, and cups, totaling $23.00,Nothing else in my cart belongs to Target, a $299 coach purse, a $1299 Apple computer, and a mandatory heart monitor and medical product that have to be carried wherever I go.Target has to have a code of conduct established with security; hiring substandard security, allowing them to conduct such egregious behavior,will cause any company to spiral.Can you imagine how humiliating it was for some hostel individual to call you my n*gga instead of addressing you with respect and dignity.The situation was illegal; you cannot racially profile, discriminate, use hostile humiliation, or accuse someone of a crime that has NOT been committed,for malicious intent.Thank you Trustpilot.com"

Got to cashiers,, amount rung up $25.99. Sent to customer service, wait in line there. Board I had was indeed $25.99. Went back to section to select $14.99. There was no $14.99 and the ironing board I selected was right under $14.99 tag. Next to table top $9.99.  Staff person met me at dept. There was no $14.99 ironing board on shelf there, but had in stock.No blank space whatsoever that would make one think $14.99 not on shelf. Then wait for salesperson to get the $14.99 ironing board. Then, back to customer service AGAIN to get refund & charged. I realize there is price scanner in store, but I should not have to scan every item I try to purchase after carefully looking at item description, location & price. PLUS make customer very inconvenienced to straighten out.  Bad business. I thought scammers were online rather than live at Target."

679,0,"On 10/06/21 and10/14/21 I visited the Northlake Target to purchase some gifts from my Nephew and his wife baby registry. I couldn't pull up the registry and neither could any of your store associates from the registry machine. I had the registry conformation in my email showing that there was a baby registry for them at Target. One of the items that I was purchasing was a baby keepsake book which was not able to buy instore only online, which didn't make sense, the store sold other item for babies. I had to order the item and the process  of ordering it on line was very difficult. Northlake Target employee Austin was very helpful and patience with helping me order the item in spite of the fact that his machine he was using wasn't work and he tried several times. I ask him to get the manager because this process shouldn't take this long to order. The manager Martin was very helpful by switching out Austin machine finding out that was the problem and order my item. I got an email saying my item was ready for pickup on 10/14/21, I called to confirm that the item was there, the associate that I spoke with that morning  said she couldn't find the item it wasn't there. I went to the store that evening where the associate Najwa try to find the item and couldn't, I had to ask to speak with the manger again in hopes that it was the same manger that help the first time, it was Martin I was so happy. Martin was able to locate my item and Najwa help with getting the other items on the registry that I needed. These three associate were very helpful , great customer service skills, they went above and beyond to order and search for my items. thank you Austin, Najwa and Martin. Ms. Davis"

She scolded me when I was standing in the queue to pay for the shopping and blamed me that  my son, who is only 4 years, was steeling candies from the store.  This has given me a shock.  I don’t believe that employee.  My son was standing there with me in the queue and he had no candies with him.  Even if my son has done something wrong, she could have told me that privately, instead of insulting me in front of the entire crowd.

893,0,"Yesterday I purchased a television from one of your stores that was a return. I brought it home today after getting a truck to pick it up, and once I get home with my brother we plug it in & it doesn’t work. The serial number on the tv and on the box also do not match. Somehow someone was able to return a $600 television with efficient return check. I was told that the vendor plugs the tv in after return & also checks the serial numbers, but neither of those things could’ve have happened with this tv. It says it was inspected on 3/29...but I know that is false. I call corporate (Spoke with Penny who said she didn’t have any other identifying factors but her first name) & explain the situation to them & all they said was I couldn’t return it because the serial numbers don’t match (even though someone already did it before) & I would need to call Samsung to see what they could do. I spent a lot of money with the store & I am a red card holder. For Target to not take responsibility for their error & make it my issue that I need to fix is unacceptable. Penny also stated that it doesn’t matter who I talk to I probably won’t get my money back & offered me $100 gift card for a broken tv that I payed $450. This is truly disappointing and I expect something to be done about this."
885,0,"Target has been much better than Amazon lately. I've spent hundreds of dollars on Target.com, mostly shipping, some pick-up orders, and I've yet to have any major issues with Target. I'd say the worst products I've gotten from Target would be 3/5 stars. All were at least OK. None were horrible. I can't say the same for Amazon or Walmart. Product selection at Target.com is smaller than Amazon and Walmart, but that's mostly a good thing: Amazon has a lot more choices, but it's hard to tell which ones are legitimate and which ones are low-quality knock-offs. Target only sells legitimate products. Having a pick-up option is useful in case I want stuff on the same day. There are maybe 3 Targets within a few miles of my apartment, so that's convenient. Again, can't say the same thing for Amazon or Walmart. The worst delivery experience I've had with Target was an order where some cans arrived dented. A similar order from Amazon had cans that arrived dented and leaking. So Target is the clear winner here."
1124,2,"First, let me say I love Target stores. This is my first time ordering from their website and it was a nightmare.I ordered 9 candles, envelopes and post its.  Everything shipped in one box except for one candle that came in a separate box on its own.  The 8 candles were simply tossed in a HUGE  box, WITHOUT BEING WRAPPED IN ANYTHING at all. They threw some bubble wrap on the top and called it a day. When I opened the box, there was glass everywhere. I even cut my finger. 4 candles were smashed to smithereens. TTwo candles didn't break but the cover had come off so the broken glass cut those candle all up so they're not attractive (normally not a big deal but these were gifts).  I went to Target.com and filled out the ""problem with order"" form and explained all I've explained here, got to choose which candles were broke and what I wanted to happen (ie, refund, replace etc) I chose refund.  There was a place to upload photos but I kept getting an error trying to submit photos so I gave up on that part and submitted the form. Also, I forgot to add, I got the post its but they never sent my box of envelopes.  After submitting form, I was told to contact them either by phone, email or online chat. I chose chat since I was already on the site anyway. The woman was not helpful, and I had to explain EVERYTHING to her, again that I'd just spend 20 minutes doing on the form. FInally they say ok you'll be refunded for 3 candles and the missing envelopes but hey you need to send back ONE of the candles?  What? Send back a box of broken glass? Finally she said oh ok you don't need to send it back....  So basically, I got 4 broken candles, am only getting refunded for 3 for some reason, and i have 2 candles that were damaged from the broken glass and I never recieved envelopes. This was a maddening experience, and I CANNOT beleive someone in 'shipping' though throwing 8 candles in a huge carton with no protection was a good idea in the first place? They didnt even TRY to wrap them in bubble wrap.Remember the one candle that shipped by itself? Yeah, that candle was in a size appropriate box and it was wrapped so well in that paper that they use to slide over fruit -- It was wrapped in so much of that it took me over 2 minutes to get all the wrapping off. that is how all the candles should have been wrapped. I'm very disappointed in Target for this - sending breakables with no protection and then their response and refund. Why am I eating the cost of the 4th candle? What about the ones where the covers came off and the broken glass cut them up so they are ungiftable?"

225,0,"I ordered for delivery, online,  1 lb of deli sliced ham and 1 lb of deli sliced turkey. These items are already pre-sliced and available in the deli cooler pick up section. They slice and wrap in 1/2 lb packages. So....If I want 1 lb, it takes 2 one-half pound packages. Probem is, MAJOR problem is that product is priced per package, not per pound. So, you are charged for 4 lbs of sliced deli product! Translation: AT $8.99 & $9.99 per lb, the overcharge is $18.98!!!!!!!!!!"

2151,0,Ordered stuff online for pickup at local store. Says items are in stock. I ordered my product and waited for my email to pick up. I get an email stating that every single item I ordered was not available in the store. I then proceeded to have a chat with their online crew. It took them seconds to take the money out of my account. They tell me I wont get my money back for 6 days.. I'm furious I'm leaving this review and contacting corporate next.

1272,0,"I ordered a dining table online. It arrived 3 weeks later, not 1. The box was falling apart and the table was broken in multiple pieces. No styrofoam protection inside the box, just a table. Because of its weight, Target put the return on me. Customer service would only pick it up if I box/taped it up for UPS (a 100lb table). So, I left the many pieces of table on the floor at my local Target return center (who also did not want it). Waiting for refund."

572,0,"Manager Ronnie Martin would not help us on a TV we bought from Target that was damaged  before pickup. Employee said it was okay to pickup. TV was purchased 2 weeks before mother's 70th birthday so it took her a couple more weeks to have it installed. Manager Ronnie Martin also said that because after 2 weeks then we would have to go through the manufacturer. So they want us to pay for shipping and time and hassle over a mistake that they made? WOW. I guess they just lost a lifetime customer over 32 inch TV, hope it was worth it to you guys. I'm taking my business to Costco now with a much more reasonable return policy. Bye Felicia."

I called customer service to find out what ""preparing for shipment"" meant.  The clueless rep I spoke with told me the items weren't in stock and she wasn't sure when they would be back in stock.  ...So apparently they were ""preparing to ship"" items they didn't even have in stock.

Their computers said they had four of these CD's but they could not be found.

Called Manager, he said he would walk around store and try to find it and get back to me...lol... Don't believe what you read at the Target website."

I don't just mean there was a tear in the bag and some got out. I mean, it was WIDE OPEN. I will NEVER again order from target online."
2080,0,What you authorize to be charged when ordering online increases after a couple of days when they charge your credit card additional amounts for your order for no reason. Called customer service and they were the most rudest people I've dealt with. Will not order anything else from Target or go into any of their stores.

2619,0,"Up to the day when Brian Cornell became CEO of Target Corp it was a great business with a unique and pleasant culture. Mr. Cornell's job, as he sees it, is to please the stockholders first and foremost and make the bottom line look good, so he sold off the pharmacy, their credit cards operations, sold off a lot of parking lot space but worst of all, he began skimping on job training. In the old days, new employees were not allowed to interact with customers for 30 days; now they move right in behind the cash register and all too often it is painfully obvious that they haven't seen any training in how to interact with people in a friendly way. Why doesn't the board fire this guy before he ruins yet another company?"
362,0,"Beware of false Target ordering.  it turns out that a lot of the merchandise sold by Target is not actually sold by Target.  They have sold their name to other people who get access through the Target website.  When something goes wrong (like when, according to UPS, the merchandise was never actually shipped) they make you wait a week and then open a case.  Who knows what, if anything, happens after that.  But whatever happens Target refuses to take responsibility."

372,0,"So much to say about this horrible store…. The most significant issue it that their prices are rip-off high.  Their employees are usually really nice, and even pretty helpful, but clueless.  They have no idea where anything is.  And they are trying really hard to unpack boxes, so when a customer asks a question they have to stop working.  Now I know we all hate interruptions at work, so how about Target hire people that ONLY unpack boxes and then the rest can actually help customers wander around searching for things??"
61,0,"I won't be shopping there anymore now that they have given in to these pseudo religious psychopaths.

After trying on the swimsuits I left them on the hook because they didn't fit.Then one of the ladies told me to get them out of the stall.I brought two out because one didn't have a hook . One lady whispered ""I think she stole."" to the other lady and pointed to me.I felt offended 😭because I didn't even have a big enough purse to fit anything in.They also asked why i didn't get any of the items I tried on.Other than that target has great products."

586,0,"We recently moved from one state to another in late September of 2021; so I went to my post office and filled out the forwarding address cards. Most of my mail arrived at my new address, but some did not. An October bill from Target for $5.15 did not arrive at our new location in October because it was not forwarded to us. Target never sent an email or letter regarding this. I did not learn of this until I finally received a statement in late December and the $5.15 balance was now overdue. I paid the invoice on Jan. 6th. Little did I knowthat all the credit bureaus had gotten the late payment. Target also reduced my credit limit by 90% without notifying me. My credit score dropped 130 points from810 destroying my excellent credit rating I’ve worked sohard to get. I am 72 now and this will ruin my credit forthe next 5-7 years all because the higher ups at Targetwill not admit my late payment was the post office fault, not mine. My wife and I have never been late on bills inthe nearly 50 years of marriage. I feel this destructionof my credit is totally unfair and unwarranted and I willnever recommend Target to anyone; would you?"
1768,2,"Purchased phones via Target with Consumer Cellular has provider. I was told the phone was NEW but it wasn't! It was refurbished with no new SIM card. Keep getting calls and text from China (?). Rep said it's the number not the phone! News flash; the number has to be linked to a phone in your hand before it can ring!! Hello!!! Motorola Phones have very limited space: Brand New? hadn't used it yet and it gives messages; ""Storage space running out"" Never downloaded anything. 3 numbers stored; 3 text msgs. Seriously? I had 6 pictures on the phone and the phone started messaging:""Phone has stopped; Messages has stopped; storage space running out"". Picture storage maxed! Mind you; I only use it for talk and text with occasionally sending pictures. The first time I tried to send a still picture, not video, it would not send; Called company over 19 times. The last person, Very nice man tried to help and even tried to send me a text after powering down over 4 times. Tried sending a 11 mb (not gb) picture 9 times! It never sent! He saw how bad the phone worked and only offered me 5.00 off my bill! Seriously? I called so many times and he still couldn't get it working!!! I have an appointment to have the SIM card changed; I will talk to the manager and if he/she won't help I will cut off my account! Wait time on hold: over 89 min combined on just 2 phone calls.I could have taken a picture of the picture I was trying to text; driven to Walgreen's to print; and mailed the picture much faster than it took to NOT resolve the issues of a brand new phone (that wasn't new). Because I had issues everytime I turned it on I rarely used it!! Don't be fooled!! Technology is not that great and companies just suck you in long enough to get your money!! They don't care about your issues! They get paid to answer the phones anyway! However, Trayvon was a very kind and patient rep who really did try to help! but I feel he could have offered to send me a new phone or take off more than 5.00!  Don't waste your time. Use a company where you can buy the phone with the plan. this way you can show them what's wrong. More reason why we need to keep our brick and mortar stores and not ""cyber"" business! Heed the warning!! I can prove all of this with documentation."

I bought it last week, it had been opened previous to my purchase, when I got it home the screen was already damaged so I returned it, I asked the manager as I was returning it if it was possible and get some sort of a discount for the inconvenience of them selling me on opened product that was damaged,  they obviously had a return and stocked it without checking it. The manager became very rude and said that they don't do that, all he could do is return it,  and I said so my time is not valuable to your employer?  With a sly smirk said that's our policy sir. Unacceptable, I went to Verizon bought the same screen protector for $10 more.  I will no longer shop at Target. The manager thought my inconvenience funny. I don't mind spending a few dollars more for good service."

1559,2,"Anyone that claims that this commercial is racist is in need of a serious smack in the back of the head. I have not tried the product, however I would be more than happy to use it now. I have no idea why all these white people feel attacked by a black woman representing her community and inspiring other black women to take a chance on being an entrepreneur. As a white woman I have nothing but praise for this woman pushing through all the barriers (and whether you want to hear it or not white people have many less barriers), she deserves women celebrating her; so celebrate this amazing woman, stop putting her down because you are in fact projecting your racism on her."
1657,0,I love Target.  I especially love that they have a commercial featuring an African American woman and how they took a chance on her. I love that she’s not only concerned about her success - she wants to make it easier for other women of color whom might follow her.  Target’s role in supporting minorities is one of the main reasons that I shop and will continue to shop at Target as opposed to Target’s competitors who are often cheaper than Target.  I’ll pay more to continue to support women and women of color.  Kudos to Target and much success to Honey Pot.

I was only supposed to be charged 95.82 on my bank but was charged the entire 120.82 and you guys took my gift card money so I was charged a total of 145.82 if you add my giftcards and what the bank charged me.

After rewatching it about 6/7 I then had to go on and look at the comments concerning “racism” as I could not find anything racist about the ad other than the white people giving it one star and calling it racist. I was completely dumbfounded and began laughing in disbelief at the one star reviews. Let me say this about the people calling out the “racism”, they’re the racist, fascist and ignorant ones. They obviously believe in white pride movement, white lives matter and the (in)justification of white police officers brutality against the black community."

When I got home, I happened to see that the same item on-line, which could be ordered for in-store pick-up, was 25% less!!  So I could have ordered it on-line and had a Target employee do the work to locate the item and bring it to customer service for my eventual pick-up.  How does this make any sense and why is it necessary for me to monitor on-line prices to get the best deal.  So stupid and frustrating."

So we decided to go home and add what we wanted on the app. More then half the items on the app are NOT available in stores AND NOT available online. What’s the f’ing point of having it on the app? Get your s*it together target, amazon is cheeper anyways!"
2286,0,"I am extremely irritated. I have now bought 2 insta pots from target and both of them were used. Yes I under stand people buy things and return things but target employees should be checking the products once they are returned. The first insta pot I bought already had everything assembled which was an indicator it was previously bought, but the pot was also all dented. And therefore didn’t work properly. I brought that one back and got another one. Once we finally got it home and looked at it we had yet again another issue. The top of the lid was covered in dried food and so was the pot. Why are the employees putting returned items back on the shelf without looking at them?? I love shopping at target but I am very disappointed with this happening twice on the same product. Who knows how many other defective things you are putting back on your shelves after people return them. It makes me want to think twice before buying things from there again"
699,0,"I’m not sure why so much bad reviews, also not discrediting anyone’s bad experience either but they have one of the best customer service I have ever encountered. I do experience issues with my order like everyone else but it’s always rectified once I contact customer service. One of my packages weren’t delivered and I didn’t notice until a week later because I ordered a lot of stuff. I reach out to them and got a replacement. Another one of my orders all items came pulled up and not sealed down and messed up the whole box. I contacted customer service and also got a replacement on those. So whatever issue you have just reach out to customer service and I’m sure they’ll do their best to fix it. And It’s a great place to shop they literally have everything you need!

The shelf arriving damaged was outside of their control, but what was in their control was handled really well. Thank you, Target!"

1844,0,"My husband and I currently have a baby registry with your company.  On Jan 9, 2020, we had a Target box left at our apartment door and my husband placed it inside after 6:30 pm.  At around 11 pm that night, my husband jumped back on the couch, with a shocked facial expression, to mention he thinks he just saw a mouse run into our bedroom.  My husband goes to check the situation, to confirm his suspicion. Long story short, my husband had to kill a full-grown mouse in our bedroom closet.  When I looked at the current Target box delivered to our house, there was a big hole in the box, dented, and tape surrounding not secured.  Our apartment maintenance came the next day to expect the unit and they found no cracks or holes that would allow for a full-grown mouse to find entry into our apartment.   It is very unfortunate, that as a company, you don't have better packaging.  Now whether the rodent enters the box from Target's personal shipping facility, or whether the box got damaged by your delivery provider (UPS/Fedex/Amazon...),  at the end of the day, it's unacceptable.  So, because of your poor quality standards for shipping product, I had to spend time out of my night/day sanitizing our place to make sure that we are not exposed to any unwanted germs/ bacteria/ disease.  So, today is Jan 30, 2020, and I am completely shocked that a company the size of Target has not even tried to make contact with me by email as requested by my previous request.  Since your actions as a ""respected"" retailer is to ignore a loyal customer, I'll just post my more than Unsatisfactory review on every website I can find, stop using my Target debit and credit card, and take my money elsewhere.As for all your other customers, beware when Target sends you a package.  Not only may a rodent be lurking inside, but they also don't take responsibility for their actions as well.Highly Upset Customer."

459,0,"On July 14th I placed an order for  Ahlmann Glass Door Library Cabinet Brown - Project 62. the original arrival date was 17th, Target changed delivery date 3 times Each day I checked the website the delivery date is change to the next day. 17th to 19th to 20th to 21st  On 20th I called and spoke to Customer Service Reps Judy,  she hung up on me, I called back spoke to April, and she said the reason for the delay was items were NOT  in stock, She reassured me this time I will be informed if any more changes  Why Target did not email me about the delayed. It's Target's fault low business not the delivery’s  fault. Very poor 2 thumbs business for Target . As long as I lived I will never order another item from Target. I will make sure my acquaintance and friends know Never to order from Target."

762,0,"I placed an order pick up merchandise in two hours.I received an email advising two of the items were no longer available and the other three I will receive August 7. I needed these items immediately so I called to cancel I was advised by the online representative that I could not cancel the order that I should wait until I receive it an return. Why can’t I cancel , this is crazy and unfair. You can provide what I needed so I have the right to cancel and not waste my time returning. I was h/u on 2 times when requesting supervisor, and called store no one answered. This was my 1st and last time dealing with Target. I shop online all the time no other company is like this terrible company. Customer service is (0). I live in Miami Gardens, Fl I will surely tell others never order online here."

1950,0,It was last Nov 7 this year when we bought $20 gift card as a birthday gift for a friend. Last  Dec 10 he informed me that he checked the balance of the gift card thru target.com and said it was empty. I called the customer service of target  and said the balance was transferred to another gift card. I asked them how did that happen?  Why was not reported to the owner. And i was transferred  to a gift card specialist Tiffany waited for 30 mins and told me my friend was hacked and there's nothing we can do. We can't refund the $20???  How come we can't refund the $20? It's not our fault our friend checked it on their website target. com. So it means target hacked their own gift card???!!! I was embarrassed because of the o balance of the gift card plus  i earned that $20. I want my cash back. I want  to warn everyone not  to buy gift cards from target!

1892,0,"I love Target.  I love their Circle program where you get 1% of dividends from what you spend to spend in the store - this is a fabulous new development because I can spend me some monies in Target, yup. I prefer Target to Walmart, always have.  I like to come get my necessary home goods, browse shampoos and other items, get some cereal, look at electronics and home decor and buy a sweater all in one place. My Target has a Starbucks, as most do now.  As well as a food counter with pizza and popcorn and hotdogs which I never eat at but would be good for kids or younger folks if you eat processed foods like that.  It also has grocery items so it's even more of a one stop shop for me.  They have really great prices on the basics and are always running promos for gift cards and amounts of purchases if you sign up for the circle program. I have not chosen to get a Target debit because I get greater rewards through my bank credit card and the interest rates are high.  The stores are always clean and I have had a few issues with self checkout but for the most part, it's a win.  At my local store I'm angry with how they never stock enough people to check folks out but hopefully they'll work that out.  I ordered two items for Christmas and they managed to arrive on time - but it was iffy there at first.  I got a great deal on the Keurig I ordered for my boyfriend and he loves it.  Customer service at the return counter is always prompt and I rarely stand in line."
1956,0,"I got a seasonal job at my local target. On Wed (4 days ago) I injured myself, possibly broke a bone in my foot. The urgent care place they sent me to couldn't xray my foot because they didn't have proper coverage for my pregnant belly. I was told today it could take up to a week for me to get any word from their health department. I am a mother of 3 with another on the way soon, and it could take a WEEK AND A HALF for them to even get my foot xrayed???? And in the meantime I am not allowed to work. Seriously, Target. I expected better from you."

However, the item never arrived and I had to reach out to customer support who told me to wait 3 days and they would confirm the issue and ship another. 3 days went by I received no email or call back so I use the reference number that I was given and was told by their overseas support department that it was going to be another 5 to 7 days. Some back and forth left me feeling like I need to shop somewhere else but I waited. Today I've reached out to them because I've had enough and I was told I need to wait another 14 days! I'm done, and I guess they keep my 200 plus dollars because well they will do nothing to honor their end of the deal"

2609,0,"I love shopping at target but I will never shop from the website again. As soon as I opened the package I saw that one of the items I bought came with the cap completely broken. I'm not sure if that was something that happened during shipping or what but I've never had an issue like that when I've ordered things online from other stores. I wasn't impressed with the packaging overall. Everything was in little plastic bags that were barely tied and just thrown together in the box. It seemed that the person doing the packaging didn't seem to care about any of the products being secure, which is concerning considering one of the products I bought was in a little glass bottle and it also brings me back to the issue with the broken cap. Not impressed."
1385,0,Absolutely shocking company. Please don't buy from them. When my order arrived the material was cheap and not the size stated. On the invoice it said for returns email customer services for authorisation and for the returns address. They never reply. A total waste of money. There is no address anywhere on their site. Stay clear.
1919,0,"I ordered my sons primary Christmas give on December 2 and received a cancellation at 4am two and a half weeks later... too late to get a new one! I am just floored at this. How do they not know what they have in inventory - for over two weeks?! I will NEVER order from them again before a holiday. If it takes them over two weeks to figure out what they have, I would not trust them with anything I need in a timely manner - back to Amazon I go. This has never happened with them. What is really crappy about this, they tried to get me a new one, but it wouldn't arrive until 12/26... which is a day late. DONE with Target.com. The kicker is - I wouldn't have been really mad about it if they would have communicated within a day or two of me ordering it because I would have time to get a different one. But nope - two and a half weeks later! I told them the only way they could fix is to pay me $150 above what I paid for the kitchen so I could order it from their competitor and pay for expedited shipping to get here for Christmas morning, which they did not do. That would have been their only saving grace. Thanks for the fail Target!"

Was told three times that after I canceled my order my money would not be pulled from my account. Guess what..... they pulled the money from my account and I have no product and all I’m told is I should receive an email to dispute the issue. No one can give me an actual number to call and there is no supervisor working ever. Read the reviews and stay away from Target.com or you’ll wish you listened"
1497,0,"During this virus time, when I have gone to Target, I have found the clerks to be very friendly and they clean their stations after each customers. There are a few things that they are low on or out of but so are all the other stores. I appreciate you being open."

Provided all the key details of identification (which belong to me for example mobile number and email) successfully matching the order, and with this Ash initially assisted me with the updates, then later when no tracking had been issued when they said it would be, I contacted them again a day later, and they rejected it.What a joke."
59,0,"First of all, I want to say I have lost all confidence in target. I had read online about a promotion of $40 if you sign up for a credit card and are approved I was approved for the card yet. I have not received my credit card Nor the promotional $40 off. Gift card I had called the target credit card company and the guy said that the card would be mailed out within three weeks with a gift card. I have not received either I am done. I will never shop at target again. I have canceled the credit card as well."

I write them back and it has been a couple of days...  I will quit shopping with them."

1291,0,I was in the store in Peachtree city . On August 11 and I noticed that Ricardo Spoke to an employee very rude and disrespectful .  It made me uncomfortable to be a customer in that store.He behaved openly hostile to the worker.  This should not happen.  I won’t be shopping there any time soon.
958,0,"Today we were in our community Target store with discouragement. Our cashier was very frustrated due to a non working cash register. This has been going on all morning with her. We felt bad for her so I went to customer service and asked for a manager. A young lady came up, she was not a manager but she would listen to me. I told her that management needed to work with their employees to make sure all equipment worked before they tried to help others. In the mean time another cashier helped us check out with the same problems the other lady was having. I even got more frustrated when the lady who listened to me went up to the first cashier and was telling her that we were upset with her. This was so far from the truth. I literally went off on her and told her she should have taken this information to a manager and not to the employee. I hope that Target can start treating their employees fair and make sure they have what is needed to be successful."
476,0,"Overall I can get what I need from online ordering.choose pick up,delivery with Shipt or shipping.I prefer delivery through Shipt.its more like a scheduled delivery so you can get your stuff at your door and not left in the weather.target should fix online system.several issues like pricing ,availability.the credit card is starting to look too much like another red card company I don’t like.please don’t .target was making improvements now it’s starting to go down some. Shipt has some issues they need to fix but that’s another review….Target please don’t limit communication with those who need to use something other than the telephone.it was fine but some employees are ruining things and access for those who need alternative communication."

2105,0,"In general, I like shopping at Target, but am providing a poor rating due to Target's decision so scale back on Market Pantry items and add the ""Good & Gather"" brand.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE EVERYTHING MARKET PANTRY!!!  Do not phase it out!!  Of any generics I have tried at any grocery store, including Pick 'N Save (Roundys/Kroger), Sendiks, Piggly Wiggly, Cub Foods, Walmart grocery, etc., etc., MARKET PANTRY IS BY FAR THE BEST-TASTING GENERIC and I LOVE the cheerful red labeling.  My refrigerator and pantry are filled with everything Market Pantry - oatmeal, popcorn, walnuts, salsa, cheese, chips, you name it.  On taste, value and attractive labeling, it has everyone else beat. Also, why in the world would you choose a boring looking, PURPLE logo for Good & Gather when Target's brand color is RED???!!!   So silly and ridiculous.  I am very upset with this change and skeptical of how the Good & Gather is going to taste.  One example is the sharp white cheddar, which I reluctantly bought because I could not find any in Market Pantry.  Does not taste as good as Market Pantry.  PLEASE MAKE A SMART DECISION AND BRING BACK ALL THE MARKET PANTRY ITEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

304,0,There was ONE cashier and 4 self checkout’s. A line that extended to the middle of the store. I left my basket. I refuse to stand in a line if the store refuses to hire workers to check you out to lay for items  it is ridiculous. It has also gotten worse!!
921,0,ordered something online for same day delivery when we were on vacation. Order was cancelled rite away and my money was takin out for a whole month 3/6 to 4/6. This was their cancellation not mine and according to customer service it has to  be on hold for a month before its put back in ur bank. The items were available online for same day delivery and when order was placed no longer available and was cancelled by them. Will never order again from them
1074,0,"There was a long line of customers, but there was only one lane open besides self check out. The line kept growing and growing. Two managers were standing there watching. One finally said to the other to call someone. No one came; the line grew longer. I asked, “Where is the person?” He said, “We are trying to find someone.” My response was, “Can’t  one of you check?” I also stated that they lost my business and left. This was in Kansas City at the Target off Barry Road. I hardly ever shop there, and I Will not return! Besides they didn’t have what I wanted anyway!!"
1988,0,12/9/19 weekly ad included promotion for $10 when spending $30 on beauty products.  All of my products were included.  My subtotal before tax was $61.43.  They only allowed 1 $10 gift card.  I went on chat and person stated they reduce the subtotal by the amount of the gift card.  So my $61.43 was $51.43 YET MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED $64.26.  WHAT A SCAM!!!!!!!

They were short staffed so had no security guard that night. By the time police got there the vandals has slashed 3 tires and bashed in the back windshield. Target took zero responsibility and both managers had an attitude. They refused to let us view the security video.I had to pay $1200 out of pocket to fix the damage to my son's Audi."

When I loaded in the car, I realized not only was it wrong dimensions it was a completely different microwave. I came back in, left the basket at the front, went to find the microwave - they had several. Picked it up and brought it to customer service. Instead of just letting me go with my correct microwave - the one that matched the one in my order. The woman required me to waste 15 minutes to “return” a microwave I never ordered - lie to the computer and say I didn’t like it instead of wrong item. Then by the time she finished all that, it was raining. So I ended up having to buy an umbrella and waste another 20 minutes of my life."
642,0,This is to inform you of my recent purchase of two frozen vegetables from your store on Nicollet Mall.One was your store brand Good and Gather Steam in Bag Whole Brussels Sprouts and the other was a Bird's Eye Product Chopped Spinach. Both were mushy and lacked a good taste. I also shop at Aldi and I have to say the frozen veggies there are much better.
1430,0,"Horrible customer service at the Sandy Store. Went to pick up an order in store from online and they couldn't find it. When they finally realized they had no idea where it was they said a refund would be coming in 7-10 days. Mind you I was out the cash, and the item. I even called the morning of to make sure item was there before I drove down and was told it would be there when I came in. Lies!!! Nowhere to be found after a 30 minute search and a complete waste of gas and time. Moving on...  I got the refund and it was 1/2 what it should have been called customer service and sat in hold for 1 hour and 45 minutes and they said there was nothing they could do. I lost half my money and also the gift card used to pay for the dress. I will never shop at target again. They have gone completely downhill.  Too bad they are so horrible compared to several years ago when they prided themselves on guest service.  Boo Target!"
1639,0,"I am so confused about why people want to chime in on this I have been actually using Honey Pot since about 2016 and I love their products and when it wasn't sold at target it is at walmart. So get over it, the commercial was inspirational to black girls and people of color that our products too can be sold in a store and be for everyone. IT WAS BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND THEY FEATURED A BLACK PERSON. TARGET IS LEGIT AND HAS BEEN BRINGING US PRODUCTS FOR US."

The damn packaging of the game was clearly NOT wrapped like the other two - in fact, it had skid marks and scratches! I’m not mad about the product itself - I’m mad about the damn security you have around allowing your employees to still approve for this HORRIBLE quality of a product to actually be delivered and COME THROUGH to it’s consumer!!!! This is DISGUSTING coming from TARGET! You’d expect it from other stores, but target??? Shame. I have the photos and all the paper work to back what I’m saying.

2461,0,"My boyfriend and I were in the Butler Target for black Friday, Thanksgiving night. He was kneeling down to grab a Firestick by caution tape they had lined up for the lines. And an EMPLOYEE took the caution tape and started hitting him in the face with it because she was upset that people kept knocking the caution tape down. I couldn't get a glance at her name tag, but she had pink hair and wore black glasses. I understand tensions are high during the holiday season especially in retail. I personally am a supervisor at TJ Maxx and understand how stressful it can be, but to do that to a person who is doing nothing more than kneeling down to pick up an item is unacceptable. I'm very displeased with the Butler store and plan on never shopping there again."

1414,0,"I asked a Target employee at the Blaine store (usually a good one) why they don't require masks, as some other retailers do. The reply showed a lack of knowledge about the virus, and about getting political with a customer. A big no no, I would think! She replied, first of all that only those who are sick need to wear masks. Since you could be ill for several days with the virus, without any symptoms, this is obviously false! Then she proceeded to say that, ""when the president wears a mask, we all will"". What a BAD example! It sounds to me like Target doesn't want to offend Trump supporters, by asking them to wear a mask. And I think Target employees need better customer service training. I would give 2 stars but previous visits there were good."

305,0,"AGEISM at Target in Rocky River, OHI just applied at Target in Rocky River to be a part-time cashier. I have an open schedule and am willing to cover shifts when needed. I am a 54-year-old woman with plenty of customer service experience. The Rocky River store is staffed with younger people but this never entered my mind until I was shockingly rejected after completing the automated interview process.  AND…I look like I am in my 40s (luck of genetics)  Even friends and family couldn’t believe that I did not get hired because they know me and my background.  So….if you are a little older, you might do yourself a favor and avoid wasting time applying at Target because you most likely will not get the job. Of course, it is hard to prove AGEISM but sad to say that Target never actually met me in person but judge me via a video interview. The first step to applying at Target is completing an outline application and assessment. The assessment takes 20 minutes or so and asks you the same question 3 or 4 different ways to find out if you are a liar, etc.  I have taken these before. We all have. The second step comes quickly because the algorithm reads the assessment results. You then get an email from Target saying CONGRATULATIONS, you’ve been selected for Step 2.  Great! Then, they send you a new email asking for a Recorded Interview (again automated, on-line). In addition to customer service, I am an experienced teacher so I took time to look professional before going on camera. I completed their practice questions and then recorded myself on answering the typical interview questions (Name a time when you collaborated with someone to complete a goal; Describe a time when you overcame a challenge. etc.)  I was clear, smiley, concise, and professional. But, the next day, I received an email explaining that they do not have a position for me at this time.  Yet, in the store, there is a big NOW HIRING sign. AGEISM is the only factor I can think of for not hiring someone with an open schedule and a relevant experience. It is a shame, because if they took the time to give me an in-person interview with a one-on-one human discussion, Target would have discovered that I am a great employee who just took a job at another Rocky River establishment.  I have employment.  I am happy, but I will never shop at Target again. Good luck job seekers. You’re going to need youth at Target."
1966,0,"Target lies about delivery dates and fraudulently makes promises about when items are available. Ordered an item on cyber monday. Delivery was to be by 12/10. 12/10 delivery changed to 12/14. Target's tracking showed it hadn't shipped yet. I did a chat with customer service, rep checked and said it would be delivered by the 12th which is when I needed it. 12/12 - not there. Did another chat - oh it's shipped but won't be here until the 14th and no i can't cancel until i receive it. Then someone created a shipping label to make it look like it shipped. Today the 13th it still hasn't shipped. Will never order here again, and am returning everything I bought to Target and will never shop there again. Amazon just gained a customer."

7,0,"I purchased 3 videogames about a week ago. They were all 3 shipped in paper mailers. 2 of the 3 had loose discs inside the cases, when they arrived. I talked to a customer service lady, and she set up a return for me for the 2 and she assured me that if I ordered those 2 again, they would be shipped in a box the second time. They arrived today, 8/16, and they were shipped in paper mailers once again. 1 of the 2 had a loose disc inside this time around. I am highly disappointed and angry with the packing and shipping departments from Target. Collector's of videogames and steelbooks beware! They do not care at all what condition your items will arrive in! Also, I talked with a customer service guy this time around, and he hung up on me. That is what triggered me to write this review, because I never write reviews."
14,0,"I had a bad experience when I had my card stolen from me. It was a bank card, not a Target card.The card was denied for shopping online for $700. I called targets corporate office the following day to try to get information on who try to use my card. The rep on the phone told me that is impossible to find out. What I do for a living I design websites and databases for major companies. I explained to the rap the information would be stored in the database.  She called me and told me I was a liar. And information like that is not stored. However, it is. The rep just didn't want to take the time to do any kind of investigation."
1918,0,"Ordered a gift on 12/17/2019. Was considering in-store pickup, when I saw text on the website saying Christmas delivery was guaranteed, and they would do ""anything"" (website had a phrase to that effect) to make sure it arrived on time.All day 12/24 my tracking said the item was out for delivery. It was changed after the fact (on 12/25) to ""in transit"". I was given the false impression that the item was coming, and not given the time to react.I understand that the holidays are a crazy time for shipping, but to guarantee delivery and promise to do ""anything"" to make sure it gets there on time, and then fail to deliver? On Christmas of all things? That's just cruel. Do not ever trust that your Target.com item will arrive when promised."

Was told 1 to 2 business days-given a case number and a week later nothing. I called back-they tell me they didn't do and now I had to wait up to 10 days to get refund. Waited STILL NO REFUND. I am so mad, I just called and they said giftcard.  My shipment had a delivery problem was sent back and not they wont give me a refund. They want to put it on a giftcard/. Are you kidding, I never touched the package, why would I have to pay. Its almost $200 they will not give me...4 phone calls, a mountain of transfers, one disconnection and still no answers. Thanks target for ruining my love of target. I will not return, I will let everyone know how bad online is and to stick to Amazon. In the end you will probably keep my money and I will get nothing back. So frustrated. I hope someone from corporate reads this and makes it right. Look at your system."

1616,0,In regards to Honey Pot Company: Black women are allowed to empower other black women and girls. It’s crucial that black women have a place in the beauty community and space to encourage other black entrepreneurs. Black girls deserve to see themselves represented and be seen. The comment section here only shows that racism is alive and well. Why do white people have to make everything about them? Grow up. Congrats to Target for giving black women the recognition they deserve and to Beatrice Dixon for making stellar products.

They said they would find a way to get us the other one, and indicated they would ship it out to us.  instead they issued me a Target gift card,  This puts the burden on me to place another order, it was Target's error, and they should take it upon themselves to get me the item.  This is an inconvenience and poor customer service.  I have asked for a credit on my card - not a Target gift card that keeps my money in the Target system.  This has caused me to not want to shop at Target in the future."

2504,0,"Long story short. They make it hard for you to pay on your Redcard so they can get fees applied (which are very very high for late fees). Somehow my card was sent to the wrong address even though I told them the correct one. They changed my primary identifying address to a girls address that used me after Hurrican Harvey just to steal my stuff. So that was more than frustrating. Now they won't mark my payments on time for my credit reporting which has messed up my credit score. Thank you for the lovely gift TARGET, after I lost everything in Harvey and then the little things I had stolen by a thief. I just got the letter stating all reports were correct on my credit report which they aren't because I had no way to pay my credit card down which was a simple $66. Y'all charge me late fees after promising to remove them if I paid the credit card down to $0 ( you guys straight up LIED to me ). Since Hurricane Harvey, Target has been one of my worst experiences. I am going to close my credit card and go back to Amazon where they care. Target is pretty evil and sooner or later is going to have to file for Chapter 8 with this type of treatment to the public. Just look at these reviews on Trustpilot! Fix your horrible company which was once great.."

236,0,"The problem with Target is they are ""woke"" and their online site isn't great. I ordered ""The Real Anthony Fauci"" book as a gift. But, they kept sending me the option to cancel or wait for the book to come in. I let it go for months, but it was available on Amazon. I wanted to see if they ever planned to get the book. Finally I ordered from Amazon. Then while the store I go to is very pleasant in a upscale family oriented area & service is great, they bombard the store with large photos of really ugly, fat, ""ethnic"" models & now clearly lesbians. I find this in your face treatment repelling. There is a reason why models were always chosen for their beauty. And why do we need all these photos? Target would prefer to offend 96% of us to please the 4%? I think I'll just boycott them. Go woke go broke."

1647,0,"I’m tired of you all. Coming from a 17 year old white boy, black women are the most oppressed group in this country. All she said was she hopes that little black girl (who are repeatedly  told they’re not good enough) can gain confidence in their own dreams and strive towards success. And what do little white girls have you may ask ? Every single disney princess. They’re fine. And I don’t wanna hear anything about Princess Tiana bc while I love that movie, she was a frog 80% of the film. To claim that a message is racist simply bc it can’t be applied to everyone is BOO BOO THE FOOLISH! ESPECIALLY WHEN WHITE PEOPLE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE OPPRESSORS. I don’t want to hear about no irish slave bullcrap bc the irish are not still feeling the ramifications of that oppression and enslavement today in this country. Racism is still alive and well and you’d be ignorant to think otherwise. Good for Target for giving a creative and ambitious black woman a chance to be successful and voice strength and encouragement to the next generation of black girls. Back to all you ignorant people, read a book, study a research paper, do ANYTHING but sit in your ignorance. i’m SICK."

It has something to do with computers not using Windows 10 or higher.Obviously Target's IT Website Dept has incompetently changed components and/or protocols which block a good number of customers from continuing to use the website.Pages show swirling icons; notice at bottom says api.target working; can't get the webpage to load completely AND if by some miracle it does, then it won't allow the Customer to Check Out.Target really needs to get their act together.  Not everyone wants to use their App, which is painful to navigate.  Especially for older or non-tech saavy people."

It's very aggravating! They made the mistake and is giving me the round around. That is a lot of money to lose! I will never buy anything from target again! Definitely don't recommend buying anything online cause you will not get your money back and will be transferred to many different people and not get anywhere!
1518,0,Ordered a dress but selected wrong size. Asked to change size but told it had been posted and they would only give a discount and no exchange.

They refused to refund me except with an e gift card from target.  So they not only took an order for something they didn’t have, but then made up a shipping date and delivery date.  Then they refused to give me my money back.  I was amazed!!   I sold the gift card and bought elsewhere.  I will never shop there again and will tell this story everywhere."
1279,0,First off I would like to say that I have been a BIG supporter of Target for 20 years and have always supported them over Walmart. In fact I have never stepped into a Walmart over the last 20 years. With that said this will be the end of my relationship with the Target corporation after the way I was treated.I placed an online order today for some Apple goods and they were cancelled because I used a gift card. I called and they apologized and said it was their mistake and they would get the order replaced. Well after being on hold and transferred to multiple people and finally ending up with a supervisor named “Jose” after multiple hours he said there was nothing he or anyone could do to get the order replaced even though he admitted it was their mistake. I was not even given an apology he said to refer to our terms and hung up on me. Before he hung up I asked to speak to a manager and he said there wasn’t one. Really? No managers work at Target? This is the absolute wort experience of customer service I have ever experienced! After being praised by multiple associates that the order would be replaced the supervisor “Jose” said no way no how and hung up on me.I will never step into a Target EVER again. Thank Jose for losing a life long customer.Case numbers are 82792214 and 82794522.

A hold of almost $300 (my order total) was placed on my bank account. They then said that the item was out of stock because the website was counting the display as being an item in stock but they can’t legally sell it for safety reasons. Had I known that, I would have never ordered from your store because they have 10 of them in Milford Oh. Milford was going to kindly hold one for me until the end of the day but my bank can’t release the funds until 11/9 (AFTER THE SALE ENDS) and target customer service can do nothing at all. Not transfer my order to Milford or credit anything to me. They don’t care that the website mislead me to believe that there was 1 TV in stock for me to purchase but really they can’t legally sell it to me. I can’t even  fathom  how this is ethical AT ALL. I used to LOVE target but I am so mad at this situation! It’s crazy!!! Better customer service at Kroger and Walmart HANDS DOWN."

Tried to contact Customer Service. Two hours and nine reps later I still did not have an answer. One agent tells me they can't help I have to call a number, the second tells me they are transferring to the correct party and nothing happens, third tells me there's a shipping charge on top of the shipping charge in the total of the order (what??) and when the stupidity of that statement was pointed out, I was told to dispute it and chat was terminated. I have seen incompetent (Amazon, eBay, Walmart are all fine examples) but Target takes the gold medal of incompetent customer service. None of the nine people I talked to had a clue what to do. We give this business our personal information and credit card numbers?? It was an attempt to avoid stores during this virus scare but next time I am risking it.

My wife is currently in the hospital and I really have more important things to handle then calling about a late charge. Completely insensitive to this, i am her husband and all I wanted was for someone to understand my situation and just remove the late charge. Unfortunately, that is not what happened they actually told me she can handle this when she gets out of the hospital - you would think that a company would look to help a customer who has much bigger issues then this, but you would be wrong. Bottom line here is - make sure whatever you need fits into their box of pat answers or you like me will be disappointed in the results, It goes without saying I cancelled my Red Card.William and Pilar hope you feel good about your handling of this."

2537,0,"I purchased a Fitbit Charge2 at approximately 1:00 PM at your Chicago McKinley Park store (located at 1940 W 33rd St). I believe this is store 2078. I went to put it on as soon as I got to my workout destination and to my dismay, the Fitbit was switched out with another used Fitbit -- Not the Fitbit that matched the purchase. I took it back to the store right away (It took about an hour due to a traffic accident on I-55) and when I got back to the store, I was told by Carlos (identified himself as the store manager) and Alejandro (Security) that they were not going to be exchanging the product and all but accused me of switching the product out myself. This was a surprise to me as the Customer Service Manager, Latrese, assured me that they found that a return was made on August 31st of the same product and that a new person had mistakenly refunded the product and returned it to the shelf in error. Her counterpart Alondra was standing there to witness this exchange. Moments later, I am approached by Carlos and Alejandro who stated that there was in fact no return on this item and that there was a discrepancy with the serial numbers. Because of this, they have to assume that the actual item was in the box at the time of purchase. Their final recourse was to have me ""take it up with the manufacturer."" This exchange was completely humiliating as other customers and Target Employees were watching the exchange. I am a longtime and loyal Target customer. I am sure that I spend thousands of dollars at this location ALONE each year. I have never stolen in my life so to be accosted with this type of accusation was completely appalling. I originally wanted nothing more than an exchange for the item that I intended to purchase however, right now, I am requesting that this incident be resolved by refund. I spent $150 dollars with Target and received nothing for it other than complete humiliation and a receipt. I am mortified at how I was treated by your team."

The one time the item arrived spilled in the box, Target was quick to refund me for the item (could not replace since it was out of stock).  But generally items arrive in very good condition"

2126,0,"Awesome thing happened today! I ran to target to grab a shirt I saw a few weeks ago that I really liked and would be great for the Luke Bryan concert this week. I got in line for a normal checkout aisle (I refuse to use self checkout, even for 1 item) and the woman in front of me was having trouble with her online coupons for her clothes. The cashier told me it might be a minute and it might be faster to go to another aisle. I assured her it was fine and I was signing up to get the same coupon anyway so I could get the deals also! As I was checking out, I made conversation with the cashier about how I saw the shirt before and I was going to this concert and she thanked me for being so patient. For the wait, she ended up giving me a $5 gift card. I was so thankful! Reasons like this is why I always 1) use regular checkout lanes for actual human interaction. I never would have known about the 20% coupon. 2) just to be genuinely kind to people, and to be patient, it can honestly get you a long way in life.Thank you Mary Ann at the Lien Rd Madison Target for making my day and reminding me why patience and kindness always goes a long way!! She was also very caring and attentive to how her customers days we’re going. She made meaningful conversation with everyone that came through her aisle. After a stressful morning at work in another customer service job, it was refreshing to meet someone like her and I hope I can be as compassionate as Mary Ann"

We came into the store a few minutes before 10:00, not realizing how close to closing it was.  The above mentioned Target employees were EACH amazing.  They eagerly each treated us like VALUED customers...  helping us find items upon request, and they were so cheerful that we never have been treated so kindly in an establishment several minutes past closing time.  Also, Audrone treated our merchandise with great care, SWEETLY ... and as Jose let us out, he was gracious that we came to his store."

I was told it would be refunded to my original form of payment and the return confirm messaging on the website said the same thing.  I received a gift card and it took 5 phone calls to get it cancelled but I never received the refund.  I received a case number and multiple people told me they would handle it and call me back.  About the 10th phone call I was told the case was closed, it would be reopened and I would get a call back.  nothing.  i finally disputed the charge through the payment vendor and received a credit within 2 days."

1390,0,"The Target in North Buffalo, NY on Delaware ave is very poorly designed. The layout is not organized whats so ever. Like they had someone just ""put it together"" Its a maze of pans are in aisle 2 but pots are in aisle 15. As an example of the poor layout. Also, They had NOTHING on the shelf's, how is it June and you have no sandals, for boys or women, no shorts, socks and underwear were limited to basically nothing! I asked one employees as i was sanding in the kids department where the boys sandals were (in case they were in a different spot the then shoes) and without even looking up from her phone she pointed randomly and and said ""in the kids area"" not even department. Um, wow thanks for that. The other 3 customer services people where however every nice and helpful. So one out of four is ok.. I will be going out of my way until they remodle this location...again."

2447,0,"I chatted with Moana to start about a technical issue i was having in my cart which was a huge waste of time. The cyber week prices that were showing in my cart the night before disappeared. No deals were working in my cart the next day even though the deals where still going on.  There was some glitch with my cart they where trying to fix as promotions would not work.  She was completely incompetent and I had to explain things over and over.  She couldn't even direct me to someone who could help. Then while I was talking to her she ended my chat (obviously she couldn't help). The next guy did the same thing on the chat. I called the service number 3 times and 3 different people said they where helping me to wait on the line while they figure it out and all 3 people hung up on me. Now I want to be clear I was completely clam and nice to all of these people. I never yelled, swore, or called anyone names. I was very sweet so nothing should have warranted everyone hanging up on me. I believe they hung up because they couldn't figure it out and didn't have the decency to tell me and pass me to someone who can help at least. I put a great deal of time into this and Target should employ better people. I wish you could review each person so that they can tell when they have bad employees so they can let them go, so it doesn't hurt their business and waste other peoples time. I had 42 items in my cart I wont be buying now. I give up trying to fix this. No more Target online for me."
36,0,Will not shop until WOKE merchandise leaves the children’s section. Your company is disgusting in advertising horrible WOKE into their innocent brains. They should not be exposed to this until they are an adult. I used to buy buy but from your company. No shopping there anymore until you go back to the way you were  by protecting the minds of the infants and children. Let them stay pure of heart and mind.
2625,0,"Don't bother with ""chat now"" cos they know nothing much more than giving you the a 1-800 number to call because its beyond their intelligence to give you any more info.  Word of warning if you are going to order on Target.com from the Uk you may as well say to yourself ""target rip me off""!  ""Target mess me about"" and ""target lie to me"" because your money is going to towards paying for ""stupidity"" worth of ""chat operators"" I bet they practice on pissing the customers off every time you chat with them. Message to Target CEO /s if you are going to want to target customers from across the pond then train your employees to learn how to do everything other than pass the buck and also have proper phone numbers for us brits to call because its no fun being put on hold when one does not have international calling program set up."

582,0,"Target.com is a wonderful alternative to Safeway and Foodland. In Hawaii pricing on many grocery items can be very pricy at Safeway or Foodland. Target in Kapolei Hawaii offers a fresh alternative and offers great savings too. They have a decent Grocery area with fresh produce and dairy. At the register, if asked the cashier will price match all of your items. Plus you earn one percent on all of your purchases. Safeway and Foodland don't come close. I recommend shopping at Target when possible!"
86,0,"Target is so far behind other stores in customer service that it is unbelievable in this day and age when everyone orders delivery. Every single time I order from them it is a nightmare, and then foolishly after a while I decide to give them another chance because I usually have a credit to use or a gift card, but end up regretting it. Now you can't even order delivery without spending over a minimum amount, even if you're willing to pay for the shipping - they won't ship to you. Then when you order over the minimum, you don't get free shipping - you still pay, and your order takes at least a week to arrive, and almost every product tossed carelessly into the box is damaged EVERY TIME. They do not care how fast you get your order, if it is right, if it is damaged, and their prices aren't even cheap. Worst store ever!"
2170,2,"Working at target has really been an experience. It has made me lose my sanity and confidence in many ways because of the work that the employees have to endure every day. They sometimes work you 6 days in a row even though it’s 4 days a week. In the bed and bath section, there’s a bunch of repacks we can’t get done because no one will help. And when we do get help, it’s only for a little bit. And they’re asking why we can’t get anything finished especially for that section. We have so many repacks (11-20 repacks on a flat) and a lot of individual boxes to get through. This job is good for workaholics, but even the workaholics talk about how this job is a hell hole and how they want to get out of here and get a new job. Everyone talks about it. Everyone who’s a team member. This is a good job for people just getting out of high school, for about 10 months to a year. And it’s super hard for autistic people. I’m an autistic girl and even they’re working me harder than I ever have and I finish all the individual boxes and part of the repacks, but I feel like nothing is enough. They’ve definitely gotten better at expectations but still, its not a good balance between work life and other stuff in your life. It’s making me and other people have insomnia when we can sleep. The balance between physical life and mental stability is not there. It makes you feel tired as heck and bad about yourself and makes you crash when you get home. Target definitely taught me how to be more efficient and faster with my freight. But I’ve pretty much given up on everything in that job. Especially asking for help. Although it seems like they have helped me a lot today, it still seems like it’s difficult for them to get help for us most times"
1460,0,"I have had issues with online orders where delivery was ticked and order automatically went to collect. Recently I explained to customer service I could not collect as I am self-isolating as I am recovering from cancer and ticked the delivery when placing order. The first person said no problem and said it would be delivered. 3 weeks later no order and still showing click and collect. I contacted customer service and they said delivery had not been actioned from store so I said please cancel order and refund. That did not get actioned either and the reply was they cannot issue a refund until goods are put back into store and if I wanted a refund I could go to the store. I was gobsmacked, if I was well enough I would have gone to a store in first place. I was more upset as I had told the customer service staff I am recovering from cancer and self-isolating and she suggested I go into a store so she did not have to deal with refund and I would be left to deal with it myself"

354,0,I'm right in this review because of everything outside the box that contributes to the high cost of food and merchandise anymore for instance in my neighborhood I just walked around and found nine Target grocery carts three of which are the dual baby seat grocery carts which I believe are between 250 and $400 so i walked into the store and asked the manager do you offer a gift card or any type of reimbursement for somebody to bring your carts back and showed her the picture of the carts in the woods and noted that they looked brand new she said yeah we just got a shipment in and we are missing over half of them already but we're not going to be bothered right now with somebody going to pick them up we have better things to do as she was standing there with two other employees talking about something other than work stuff like that is why our prices are skyrocketing and now they're going to put chips in the wheels with a motherboard at the store and all that is going to cost us money for the simple fact of people taking grocery carts well it wouldn't be that hard to offer a simple gift card for somebody to return them she didn't even ask where they were or nothing she could have appeared less that is not a manager to me Target really needs to look at offering something up for cart returns
1056,0,"Ordered a couple of items on target.com and this has turned out to be the most insane customer experience so far in my almost 49 years on this planet. They never sent the order. I called to try to get it straightened out and thought they did it...but NO they messed it up further. I ended up with 2 separate orders and then eventually 4 different shipments...only 2 of which they ever shipped. The others didn't come. I have talked to various managers for target.com and they can't even make sense of all of the craziness and how every person who has gotten involved has messed it up more. Still trying to get my money back, which was supposed to happen, but I guess they messed that up too. Do yourself a favor...don't use target.com!"
1139,0,"Let me just start off with that I’m beyond disappointed with the target corporation itself . End up making an order of 600 dollars a couple days online for free pickup , get an email saying it’s ready . When I get there no rider exists and at this point I’m already charged on my red card . Now fast forward to yesterday I call corporate and everything saying I want a refund . They continue to give me the run around saying there is a glitch in the system and then send me a 100 dollar gift card for the inconvenience . Now less then 5 minutes they state they can only refund me if I give them back the 100 dollar gift card they issued me , are you kidding me ??? So pretty much your holding my whole refund over a 100 dollar gift card that you issued me ? This is unacceptable please share this everywhere and I wouldn’t recommend ever using target.com ever again . By the way then find out they canceled my order without notifying me u til hours after I went to the store in sayville New York"

2545,0,I have always liked 🎯 Target but my experience in the last couple of years has changed. Todays experience has to be reviewed. I went to the knightdale NC location to pick up a pair of pruning scissors to cut some small branches that are covering the driveway. I noticed the ones I purchased does not cut branches so I asked for the area to find the item. I found it also picked up some weed eater and proceeded to the front. Once I was at the guest desk I was informed that I could not exchange the product for the right one due to them not excepting a exchange for 24hrs. Which is not stated in the return exchange policy. I expressed this to the manager and she informed me that it was NOT in the policy. I was then told to get my receipt from my email. I left the store came back from the car with my phone pulled up the receipt she scanned it nothing she then expressed she couldn't do it but it will work in 24hrs. I stepped to the side because a line had formed and asked for corporates number. I also expressed that it not the money it was only 6.99 the item I was exchanging for costed 29.99 I was giving more money with the exchange it is the principle to not have a policy which states a consumer cannot exchange or return within 24hrs. This takes away a consumers choices to shop with no worries that if the product brought is not correct it cannot be exchanged or returned for 24hrs with or without a receipt.After speaking with the 800 number which has options I spoke to one man then after I expressed the issue above he put me on hold and another lady came on. She expressed after I told her what had happen that the manager was right and that it is no policy. She then expressed that she would let the leader something I can't remember what she called it. I then asked for someone over her she said no one was over her but she could put in a request for someone to contact me within 24 to 48 hours and placed me on hold. 9min later she came back and said no one would be calling she would just give me a egift card for 6.99 plus tax 7.50 and could she have the order number. I gave it to her she said 4hours it will be in my email and hung up. Now see I feel like from beginning to end was disrespectful.  She never even had my information but left me on hold to have to ask for my order number then to express 4hrs for your egift card and hang up like I did something.
822,0,If I can give no star I will. I called the customer service 3 times to change the address where to deliver it to because I made mistake and they cannot resolve it. They keep telling me to try to call the next day and now it going to deliver in the wrong address and they told me they cannot do anything about it? Omg!!!!... are they serious. How can be customer service be so bad on this. I do not want to pay for the item that I am not getting and it’s not cheap what I order. Aweful customer service.
2241,0,"Will never go to Target or order anything from them on line again. I order things on line for a baby shower and the delivery date said it will be at my house by the 31 of may. If it had another date I would have done the same day delivery due to the fact the baby shower was on June 1st. When I called the so called supervisor said I should try an alternative> I stated what alternative you do not have any of the products in your store that she had on her registry. Then I stated I would have done the over night if I would have known the date was wrong. She then stated they don't offer that. I said then you need to change your website and you need to put different dates when people order from you. She said it doesn't say guarantee I said well it doesn't say any other dates either. It just said the date it would be here, Then I spoke with someone else a friend of mine and she stated that she has been waiting for 3 weeks for her delivery from Target. Very poor customer service and very poor delivery info they give you. I order a product from amazon for the same dates the free delivery stated 31st-4th so i chose to pay the extra 30 for it to come on the 31st and guess what it did. I would have never would have chose the 31st through target if I knew it was not going to be at me house,"

715,0,"I bought an Amazon Paper White from this store. It was supposed to be a 10th generation, thats what I asked for and what was on the Box. I also bought a case to go with it. The case, that was recommended by an employee didn't fit I did a lot of research and bought another case. The new case didn't fit either and I called Amazon. After trouble shooting with them for about 30 mins they had me give them the serial number. Turns out the model I had was a 7th generation Paper White. I asked for a 10th generation, I was given a box that said 10th generation but in the box was a 7th generation. Not the end of the world mistakes happen. Then I reached out to Target and they told me they wouldn't give me the correct device. How a billion dollar company thinks it's ok to sell an older model labeled as a new one is ok is unbelievable to me. I wrote a review on their Facebook page and after pretending they were going to help me out told me there was nothing they could do. Imagine going to buy 2021 Camry and when you get it you realize it's actually a 2015 and the dealership tells you there's nothing they can do. I've been a loyal Target shopper for as long as I can remember, I go there multiple times a week and probably spend 8-10k dollars there a year. Things go wrong and people make mistakes, I have no problem with that. The fact that the company lied about the product they were selling, disguised it as a newer model and refuse to make it right is very disappointing. To top it off, the company deciding it was ok to not make it right is unforgiveable.Here's a quote from their CEO Brian Cornwell""Guest trust is critical to our success - trust in our products, our services and our actions. And this trust, built up over decades of ethical practice, can either be enhanced or eroded by the decisions we make each day.""He couldn't be more right.Turns out they have a ""Code of Ethics"" that each employee is supposed to follow. Either every single person I spoke to about this issue is in violation of this code or it's just a bunch of hot air. So far through their action, I'm going to file it under hot air. Just another Billion Dollar business stepping on the backs of the little guy and marketing themselves as moral.Finally I took another quote from pg 19 of their code of ethics:""Always make sure that product attributes accurately represent the quality, features and availability of our products""Another lie. If a company is ok swindling someone over a $150  piece of Tech, is ok with mislabeling items and ok with letting a loyal customer walk away with their $10,000 annual revenue, doesn't back up the word of their CEO... what else are they okay with?"

838,0,EFW Company is working with Target and combination of these two have the worst customer service. They scheduled my Return pick up and never showed up and their customer service agent hang up phone without clear answer. I have spent a long time on phone with Target and EFW to be able to find a way to schedule a confirmable pick up time (Hope they pick it up this time). As long as you buy stuff from Target they are servicing a delivery but return back to Target via EFW has been my worst customer service experience. The return was due to their mistake delivering the wrong packages. Target or EFW are not helping with making our life easier. Wont buy anything online from Target anymore. Defiantly wont do business with EFW .

2186,0,"Really disappointed in Target.  For the last 15 years they have been sponsoring the ice cream at our National Night Out in Denver at Cook Park.  They have always given us ice cream, sprinkles, toppings, bowls, utensils  and employees to help us serve. National Night Out is observed all over the country and is a community building event with the Police Department in each city.  Ours includes the fire department and first responders.  The Cook Park Event is one of the largest in Denver and usually has 600-1000 homeowners and neighbors attend.  Most of whom I assume shop at Target.This year Target has decided that they are NO LONGER sponsoring National Night Out.  I have reached out to the corporate offices for an explanation but no one who answers the phone is allowed to put me through to anyone who can offer an explanation.  Just want to know Target. There are a lot of people who look forward to that Target ice cream on a hot August night."

The last representative, Nik, wasn’t able to inform me why I have zero $ on my electric gc when I never used, so I asked to speak to a supervisor who hopefully would be able to inform me any better and Nik put me on hold for 25 minutes and then instead of transferring my call he gets back on the Line and trying to explain to me which was completely wrong. I literally screenshot the 25 minutes hold time but for some reason I’m not able to copy& paste here. Absolutely terrible customer service. The same issue with a 40 minutes hold time happened on my previous order from Target.com and then Leah the representative literally hang up on me. Rude, zero knowledge and not helpful at all!!! They should learn a thing or two from other online stores. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
1469,0,"Here is the email I have been trying to get a response I wanted to reach out and see if you could possibly assist me with another issue I had at the store day before yesterday. I spent about an hour and a half with your staff in the electronics department. We spent a great amount of time discussing the system I had at home the speed I was receiving for the Internet the type of Wi-Fi router I currently had and modem etc. I was very hesitant to make the purchase however the gentleman was extremely assertive and assured me that it would work perfectly fine with my system. After getting home yesterday and having the opportunity to call a TNT which is our Internet provider, I learned that the staff was incorrect. It’s not so much the fact that they were incorrect that bothers me as we are all human. What bothers me is, the gentleman was so assertive I felt like I had to make the purchase because if I did not I would’ve been wasting his time. I was very hopeful that it would work. I also learned that the reason it will not work is a very specific reason that something somebody on their first day on the job would know. And that is, you always have to have an AT&T modem for AT&T provided service. There is no way around that that has always been standard and a well-known rule according to AT&T and 2 Target associates I spoke to you today.What has me reaching out to you is as follows: of course I was not thinking about the virus affecting the policy for your returns and it was never discussed with me during the conversation with the staff member, And I have made several comments about if it don’t work I can just return it the next day right? And they assured me I was correct.Fast forward to today I am writing you in requesting An exception be made due to the circumstances noted above. I am currently out 240+ dollars for this device that I purchased. The device and packaging have not been opened. It is the Google Wi-Fi system. I have the receipt and I would be very grateful if you could allow an exception to be made today for a return that way I can purchase the right equipment to allow Internet back on at my house for my kids to complete their schooling. an exception be made due to the circumstances noted above.

2091,0,They have just remodel this target store ( Pueblo Colorado)and I don't know what has happened but the service has gone down hill fast. I was going to get in line to check out and there was not one check stand open you had to go to self check out which is fine if you don't have a lot of stuff but not only did I have a lot stuff but you had to wait in line to do self check out. Not only did I have clearance stuff(which they have to do) but I also had cold medicine (they also have to help with) so you have to wait for that . But what really upset me was the lady next to me trying to by a toy for her child being told she could not buy that toy because it doesn't go on sell until Monday (this was Friday)the women said she didn't understand it was on the shelf why couldn't she buy it ? The target person just said it was not for sell and she would have to take it and did just that leaving that poor women and hear kids just standing there it was sad. I not sure what happened to customer service but there was no customer service just sad kids.

485,0,"I dare ANYONE to find customer service that ACTUALLY WORKS.  The useless ""contact us"" page is the epitome of colossal failure.  NO ability to contact anyone.  The ""chat"" page is a dead end.  The website is the epitome of a classic disaster.  When put several items in cart, and the inept thing won't let you open the cart to see what is in it, OR place the order, that is a guaranteed failure.  Hint: you can hire a more than capable 12 year old, a few hours/week to eviscerate the onboard grand fool software and force the pathetic site to WORK.  The site USED TO operate partially.  One could find items, order them.  Then the site would shift into government mode, and create NOTHING works.  However, one could copy the cart contents and find a legitimate site elsewhere to actually get what was needed."

2332,2,"I recently created a baby registry and it said I could stop by anytime to pick up a free basket full of samples and coupons. I just stopped by and was told they were all out. I asked when they were getting the next shipment - the woman said it comes monthly and she wasn't sure when they got it last time.  Finally,  I asked if I can leave my name and number and have someone call me when it comes in. She said ""I can take your info but can't guarantee someone will call."" I understand this item is free,  but it's a big reason why I made a registry there to begin with.  I think I will be taking this registry elsewhere."
2272,0,Anyone interested in getting their Red Card should think twice about it before they do because their fees are so high that you will never end up paying off your balance because nothing you pay ends up going towards your principal amount. There is no grace period on this card so if you are even a day late they will charge you 25 dollars. This company has made my life a nightmare  and we paid our bill. Be careful with your information because their customers information has been hacked before. The worst thing yet was I posted a negative review on their Facebook page  late last night and within a few minutes I had over 75 nasty responses. Over 132 in an hour. It would not stop so I removed the review and only warned people not to place a review there because their employees would attack you and I still kept getting nasty comments the rest of the night. I know from past experience you do not get answers to your review in that way so I have no doupt it was company employees that harrassed me all.night long and that by far is the worst behavior I have ever seen out of a company. And dont try getting ahold of their corporate office because you cant. They hide from their customers.

1012,2,"Undocumented store policies, which caused me unnecessary travel. A store's return policies should be clearly stated PRIOR to customer transactions. The policy which prevented me from returning items that I purchased only a few hours earlier & had a receipt wasn't listed on the receipt, the checkout counter, customer service, nor the website. Not a single employee could show/prove this ""policy"" was printed anywhere. Awful experience, wasting my time & fuel costs for an unnecessary return trip. Never shopping at any Target every again."
1585,0,"It's amazing that people still don't get where the start and finish lines are for people of color. What's wrong with a black woman wanting little black girls to know that they can be whatever they want to be and succeed? Are 90 percent of the products in Target made by black women so there's no need for that commercial to be made? No, and I'm pretty sure if they were that the people making the racist comments wouldn't even shop there. People of color are just trying to get where everyone else is as far as success goes. If you forgot, WE didn't have the same start in this country as the majority. We didn't have businesses past down to us, we just got the same education about 30 years ago( inner cities still trying). So, to all the people that have a problem with the black woman that was given a chance and is trying to pull other little girls that look like us up, GROW UP!!"

1885,0,The customer service for gateway center mall pick up services suck and is very unorganized. I order a carseat for my son online and had to pick it up in the store only to be told 2 days in a row it couldn't be found. One of the employees at pick up services in the store by the name of Tatiana kept me waiting for about 30 minutes then lied to me and told me because they misplaced the carseat I could just cancel my order and call target online service and get a refund back to my card immediately the same day (Which turn out to be a complete lie) and then she tried to offer me a $10 gift card to get rid of me. The only highlight was a manager in customer service by the name of Felicia. She handle things swiftly and promptly and made sure I left with what I needed and felt like a satisfied customer. They need to hire more people like her and fire the rest of them. Because they clearly don't value there job. If your reading this thank you so much Felicia for your help tonight you was a absolutely gem. And target should give you a raise because if everyday is like it was tonight you got your hands full with the staff you got. I'm going to pray for you girl.

With Sam’s I’d have to wait days like HEB but the comparison isn’t really fair as Sam’s has really big orders. But I’m satisfied every single time I’ve made an online purchase with target."
1588,0,"I am sharing some knowledge. The owner of the honey pot company really deserves good. She did say some racist stuff but i dont think it was intentional. Its sad though that she doesn't want all woman to succeed at all. Just only blacks. Real female business owners want all woman to succeed no matter the race. Females struggle to own business now a days not just blacks females. Men get paid more then females they say yes to men more then females. Instead of seperating we need to literally get together and fight for females to come together. EVERY FEMALE BUSINESS owner should succeed.  You never hear white business owners say ""i am doing this for all white females"" because black community with have a tantrum over that. Like they did with the hoodie thing ""king of monkeys"" even though the black mom agreed qith the hoodie for her own black son. Wow just crazy how alot of black people still see black and white only.

Saying mam you need to put on your mask or you can't shop.I was calm and looked at her and said I am exempt.She looked at me and said with WHAT! as loud as she could almost as if to draw attention.I told her I didn't have to tell her why according to ADA AND HIPAA.Then she told me that didn't matter that if I didn't put a mask on she was calling the cops..I said ""You do that"". Then she said I hope they give you a citation. Well, I went about my business got my dogs dental treats went up to check out with no problem and as I was walking out the door to put my buggy up another little mask troll walked up to me yelling that I need to put my mask on... I just looked at her and said I'm leaving I'm not putting a mask on I don't have to I am exempt and that's all you need to know.She them said she was going to trespass me And I would not be allowed back in the store.She was very rude but I guess this is just how the employees are allowed to act.This was so uncalled for in the way they treated me with no respect at all.Target you need to get your employees in check before they cause you a lawsuit.Even the Governor set guidelines for those with exemptions.Its not for your employees to pick and choose who they want to believe and mistreat."
380,0,"I was shopping at the Illinois branch last Friday when I was approached by a young child with blonde hair. I pinched their cheek and pat them on their head before gasping and clutching my pearls, ""What's your name?"" the child looked up to me with brown eyes ""Luka!"" they said, holding a copy of Bayonetta 3 in their hands. I giggled before adding ""What a handsome young man you are!"" Before I could say ""Wash me a dog and slap a hillbillie with a nutcracker"" an employee that worked at the store approached me heatedly. Her accent was thick. Maybe Russian. Maybe German. No- she was... Lithuanian. ""Hey there!"" she called ""You swashbuckling n*gger! Don't you dare call my child a man. They're nonbinary"" I gasped, unsure of whether I should smack a b*tch or turn the other cheek. But when I looked in her hands I saw that she had a Lithuanian spell potion and would use it if I responded. So I ran out of the store."

1506,0,Don’t shop online and have it delivered. They put a 35lb bucket of cat litter in the same box with the other items that I ordered. The order that I placed cost me 190$ and it crushed everything. The one single box that it all came in was so heavy I couldn’t even pick it up. Target warehouse packers have to be the worst in the industry.
1493,0,"My local Target does not care about their community. I hadn't been there in weeks, but today I needed toothpaste and a few other supplies. I was shocked to see not only customers but some of their employees not wearing mask or wearing them incorrectly. I saw three people who had no masks at all. When I asked one of the employees, they replied that it's a county ordinance, and they can't enforce it. When I told them they could refuse them entry, another employee came up and said it's up to corporate. So even though the County of Riverside has stated you must wear a mask in public or be fined and that stores can refuse you service, this Target would rather let people without masks in to spend their money than keep the rest of us safe. I will not be back for a very long time."

Makes sense... ships Tuesday and comes Thursday. On Weds, I get an e-mail that my order is delayed. Ok, that's fine, things happens. It shipped Thursday, so I assumed it should be at my house Saturday (2 days). I checked the tracking to make sure and it is scheduled to be delivered on TUESDAY, 8 DAYS after I made the order! That is NOT 2-day shipping! I specifically chose 2 day shipping so I wouldn't have to run too many errands on my busy weeknights. Now that it's being delivered next week, it's pointless because now I have the weekend convenience to go into the store buy one myself! But I can't because the delayed one is on its way! So now I'm just waiting stupidly. Please don't claim 2-day shipping if you can't adhere to it. Even if there is a delay BEFORE shipment, slap an expedited label on the shipment to adhere to the claim. I know crap happens, but I can't trust Target to deliver on time anymore. I even chatted with someone on Target.com to cancel the shipment, and they said it already shipped, giving gave me a vague answer as to why there was a delay."

Because of these facts, now I have an even lower opinion of Target Corporation than I did before I searched for 'Miley Cyrus reviews' at DuckDuckGo.

291,0,"Horrible management customer service.   This past year we had twin boys and have spent thousands at Target as it had become our to go place for anything we needed for our babies.  However this past weekend left a very bad taste.  We went into the store at Memorial attached to Memorial City mall in Houston for what we expected to be a quick hassle free return of a $30 birthday gift our in laws gave our babies.   For some reason the lady at the return counter was having trouble processing the return and in order to avoid holding up the line we decided to move aside and politely ask a lead/manager by the name of Matt Mutschler if he could please assist since we had the item in it's original packaging and online receipt with the bar code that clearly stated ""this barcode works as your receipt for in-store returns"".  He very rudely and in a condecending manner refused to even look at the item or the receipt and told us that if the system was not finding it there was nothing he could do.  We asked how we could proceed to return the item in this situation since it was purchased 3 days ago and he said he couldn't think of any options and proceeded to walk away.  Without even looking at the clearly new unused item in it's original box and the receipt, he did quickly mention it may be an old item we were trying to return.  Since we had never had this issue before, we decided to call Target's customer service from the store and they said that what we had is all we needed to process the return.  We approched Matt again while he was speaking with a cashier and addressed this to him.  Since she quickly noticed he had no interest in assisting or even looking at the item or receipt she offered to give it a try herself to see if she could help.  It took her less than a minute to process the return and said she did not understand why the original cashier at the return counter was not able to process and that she might be a new employee.  I understand new employees need time to get acquainted with the system however there is no excuse for a lead supervisor to refuse to even try to assist when one of their new associates is having trouble processing what should have been a simple return.  We hope this gets to someone with some authority at Target and is addressed and given serious attention since I'm sure we are not the only customers that have been treated in this very unprofessional manner by this supervisor."

Then I just so happen a day later to look at my bank statement and I have a random $5.00 charge from target.I call to find out and low and behold I had to wait a few days for my “free target gift card” because they had charge me for it first. THAT IS NOT FREE! Then to try and get the $ back and correct the situation is another story, it’s been 4 months and I’m STILL waiting. I immediately contacted target guest service and showed them the charge and how even though they charged me for the gift card I still haven’t even received it, the woman says “oh yeah that how we are able to give out the free gift cards” well umm that isn’t free when your charging me for it.

We ask if they have any scissors and they just say no we don’t she was very kind though. She says we could go up to customer service and they could cut it off for us right away. We go to customer service and the three girls are gossiping about they’re just secretly like whispering and like laughing and we ask if they have any scissors so we could cut our stroller apart so we could use it for my baby cousin. They rudely rudely replied with an answer of do you have a receipt? My grandma was livid at that point and said that that’s insulting and we walked away.Then they just continued with their Gossip. When there’s millions of cash registers that they could open and help people because there’s a big line. We get out to the car and we start using nail clippers to cut open our stroller i’m 12 and I got injured and cut myself twice trying to open the stroller. Thank goodness I had caffeine before having to go through such rudeness and inpolite respect. We got to the mall though and we had a great time.

2298,0,"I received a gift card for Target.  I wanted to buy a simple $10.00 item. The site said the item  was available for pick-up in store, so I ordered it on line to pick up.  They required all of my information; phone number, e-mail, etc and said I would need to agreed to ads, etc.  I ordered the item with my gift card.   They said they would e-mail me when pick-up was ready.  1/2 an hour later they said it was not available in the store and I could go somewhere else or get free delivery in a few days.  Now they have all of my info and I cannot access the item I want today.  Corporate piracy.  I fell for it.  Never again."
1428,0,"I never got a refund for a $90 chair I returned (Target sent the incorrect one for an online order) mailing company tracking confirmed it arrived back with target within 2 weeks and gave me the name of the  employee that accepted it.  I both called and emailed target within a month and received no help. I spoke to customer service again over a year later because I was still so upset that they took my money and $90 is a lot to me, the manager was nothing but rude to me on online chat. I'm so disappointed, as I love Target stores and I made my baby registry there, but it is simply unacceptable to steal money from a customer when I didn't keep the product. I can't believe they would treat a loyal customer this way and not want to retify it."
517,0,"I made an order over the weekend as I was sick and couldn't really shop.  Out of five items I ordered, two were totally incorrect.  So, I contacted the chat person to hopefully straighten it out.  I was very clear that instead of red organic potatoes, I received yellow potatoes (non organic) and instead of apples got tomatoes.  This was clearly a lack of attention to detail.  The chat person (who I thought was listening, said, ""Oh, do you mean these English muffins?""  This after I clearly laid out which items were wrong.  Then they promised to do a refund.  They did not.  This world is really in trouble with young people not knowing how to spell, write a sentence correctly, or identify fruits and vegetables.  These kids are the future and it's scary.  No way I order from Target again.  They lack the integrity and intelligence to do what they claim to do.  It wasn't that hard - five simple items."
351,0,"This evening I purchased some personal items and groceries at target on Gilbert Road in Chandler Arizona. I had an appointment after that stop so I didn't get home for another 2 1/2 hours and when I did, I discovered that part of my groceries and personal items were not put in my cart and therefore they were left with the cashier at target.  When I called about it because I have to have some of those items for surgery at 5 AM, target refused to deliver them to me even though I paid for them and it was their fault that they did not put in my cart .  I have to drive 10 miles one way to go get them at 9 PM so I hope I never have to shop at target ever again."
1879,0,Never get there credit card I feel on hard times and I went to collections I tried settling without the $600 in fees they charged me and the refused to work with me. Theyre garnishing m’y check more than the legal 25%. I spoke with the collection company their using and they can’t even give me a copy of what all I’m being charged and why my payments I made wasn’t factored in. Lesson learned I won’t spend my money with target ever again
2085,0,"worst place to shop, poor customer service and unorganized. My husband bought a fat free lactaid milk for me, and came to find out it was open and was used, I took it back, milk he paid for $3.99, because I took it back without the receipt they gave me a refund of $1.34. Thats cheating. Please check you food stuffs before putting them on the shelf. Stop reaping us off our money."
2487,0,"Ordered two items. One arrived, second one was the wrong item and was so huge I couldn't carry it by myself back to the ups store to return it (and they don't offer item pickup). To make matters worse, they never sent the replacement, and when I called a week and a half later to find out why it never arrived, they told me they didn't stock the item any longer and were never going to send it. Well when were they going to tell me? Never, apparently. I guess they were going to keep my money and earn interest on it until I called them. The people on the phone were nice once I called them though."
